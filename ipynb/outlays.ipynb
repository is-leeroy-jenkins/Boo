Introduction","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n#### Abstract\nThe Federal Budget Outlay Forecasting Model is a comprehensive analytical framework designed to project future budget outlays for the United States government. Given the complexity of federal financial planning, this study applies statistical techniques, machine learning models, and time series forecasting methods to ensure accurate predictions. Using historical budget outlay data spanning from 1962 to 2024, the analysis incorporates descriptive statistics, inferential hypothesis testing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and time series forecasting to provide actionable insights. By leveraging batch processing and dimensionality reduction, the study addresses computational challenges associated with large datasets. The findings highlight the significance of historical budget trends, the need for advanced forecasting techniques, and the effectiveness of ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The results serve as a foundation for policy formulation, fiscal planning, and government expenditure analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Background\nFederal budget outlays represent the actual expenditures made by the U.S. government, covering areas such as defense, healthcare, social security, infrastructure, and public welfare.

Time-Series Models\n___\n##### ARIMA Model:\n\n- Captures historical trends effectively.\n- Forecasts show smoother growth with minor fluctuations.\n- Works well for data with strong temporal dependencies.\n##### Holt-Winters Model:\n\n- Accounts for seasonal variations in data.\n- Forecasts show more adaptive trends based on past variations.\n- If seasonality is not strong, it may underperform compared to ARIMA.\n##### Comparative Observation:\n\n- If budget outlays exhibit strong autoregressive patterns, ARIMA is generally more effective.\n- If there are recurring patterns (e.g., election-year spending spikes), Holt-Winters may perform better.\n### 2. Regression-Based Models\n___\n\n##### Linear Regression:\n\n- Provides a simplistic linear trend based on past years.\n- Cannot capture non-linear relationships or sudden shifts in spending.\n- Generally underperforms compared to more complex models.\n##### Gradient Boosting & Random Forest:\n\n- Perform significantly better by capturing non-linear relationships in budget trends.\n- Gradient Boosting provides the most stable forecast with strong predictive accuracy.\n- Random Forest also performs well, though it can be sensitive to overfitting in smaller datasets.\n### 3. Insights\n___\n\n##### Best Performing Model:\n\n- The Gradient Boosting Regression model gave the most realistic forecast for budget outlays based on historical trends.\n- ARIMA was the best time-series model, showing a balanced and smooth trend.\n##### Key Observations:\n\n- Regressions rely on feature relationships, whereas time-series models use only past values to predict future trends.\n- Hybrid approaches, combining time-series and regression-based forecasting, could be used to improve predictions.\n### 4. Recommendations\n___\n\n##### For near projection (1-2 years ahead):\n\n- Use ARIMA for stable and structured growth trends.\n- Use Gradient Boosting Regression to capture complex patterns.\n##### Long-term forecasting (5+ years ahead):\n\n- Combine time-series models with machine learning (hybrid approach).\n- Introduce economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, debt levels) as additional predictive factors in regression models.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Discussion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Model Performance and Insights\nThe Federal Budget Outlay Forecasting Model successfully applied a combination of statistical analysis, regression models, and time series forecasting to predict future budget outlays. The key insights gained from the modeling process include:\n\n##### Descriptive Statistics & Probability Distributions\n\n- The dataset showed a right-skewed distribution, indicating that a few large expenditures drive overall budget trends.\n- Non-normality of the data required feature transformations before applying machine learning models.\n- Uniform distribution testing confirmed that budget outlays do not follow a random pattern, reinforcing the need for advanced forecasting models.\n##### Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing\n\n- The T-test confirmed that budget outlays significantly differed from zero, proving that expenditures are consistent over time.\n- ANOVA analysis revealed significant variation between fiscal years, suggesting that certain years experienced abnormal budget trends.\n- Chi-square tests validated that budget outlays deviate significantly from a normal distribution, necessitating nonlinear models for accurate forecasting.\n##### Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction\n\n- Min-Max Scaling and Z-score Standardization improved model performance by transforming variables to a comparable range.\n- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) effectively reduced data complexity while retaining variance, making the dataset manageable for computation.\n- K-Means clustering identified three budgetary spending patterns, helping in categorizing expenditure trends across different agencies.\n##### Regression Modeling and Performance Evaluation\n\n- Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression provided a baseline but failed to capture complex nonlinear budget trends.\n- Ridge and Lasso Regression improved generalization by adding regularization, reducing overfitting.\n- Bayesian Ridge Regression performed well in handling uncertainties in budget fluctuations.\n- Gradient Boosting and Random Forest Regression emerged as the best-performing models, capturing both short-term and long-term variations in government spending.\n##### Time Series Forecasting Analysis\n\n- ARIMA forecasting captured historical trends and predicted expenditures based on past budgetary fluctuations.\n- Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing effectively modeled seasonal and trend variations, proving useful for forecasting cyclical spending.\n- Comparing ARIMA and Holt-Winters forecasts revealed similar trends, though ARIMA was slightly better for long-term forecasts, while Holt-Winters handled seasonality better.\n##### Error Handling and Computational Optimization\n\n- Batch processing prevented memory overload while handling large datasets.\n- Automated model selection based on R-squared values ensured optimal model performance.\n- Reducing the dataset to fiscal years 2012-2024 allowed efficient model execution without compromising forecast accuracy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Key Findings\nThe Federal Budget Outlay Forecasting Model successfully demonstrated that historical budget trends, machine learning regression techniques, and time series forecasting can effectively predict future government expenditures.

Descriptive Statistics & Probability Distributions\n- The dataset spans fiscal years 1962 to 2024, covering multiple agencies and budgetary accounts.\n- Budget outlays exhibit a skewed distribution, with a few large values driving the trend.\n- The histogram suggests the data is not normally distributed; it has a right-skewed pattern.\n- A uniform distribution does not fit the data well, confirming that budget outlays follow a non-uniform pattern.\n- Further statistical transformations (e.g., log transformations or scaling) may be needed before applying machine learning models.\n\n#### B. Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing\n- T-test result: The p-value (0.0000) indicates a significant difference from zero, confirming that budget outlays are statistically different from zero.\n- ANOVA test: The p-value (0.0047) shows significant variation between fiscal years, meaning outlays are not constant over time.\n- Chi-square test: The p-value (0.0000) confirms a significant deviation from a normal distribution.\n- Confidence Interval (95%): The estimated range for the true mean budget outlay is 7768.03 to 7868.64.\n- These tests validate that budget outlays change over time and do not follow a normal distribution, supporting the need for specialized forecasting models.\n\n\n#### C. Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction\n- Min-Max Scaling successfully normalized the budget outlay data between 0 and 1.\n- Standardization (Z-score) ensures a mean of 0 and variance of 1, which is useful for machine learning models.\n- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduced dimensionality to 2 principal components while preserving key variance in the data.\n- K-means clustering identified 3 distinct groups in the dataset, suggesting underlying patterns in budget outlays.\n- Factor Analysis extracted 2 latent factors, aiding in feature selection for predictive modeling.\n\n#### E. Correlation Analysis\n- Pearson correlation analysis shows strong relationships between adjacent fiscal years, suggesting continuity in budget trends.\n- Kendall’s Tau and Spearman’s rank correlations confirm similar ranking trends, indicating consistency across fiscal years.\n- High correlations suggest that historical budget outlays can effectively predict future values, supporting time series modeling.\n- Outliers and abrupt changes in correlation patterns indicate shifts in budget policies over time.\n- Further analysis should explore external economic or political events that may have influenced budget fluctuations.\n\n#### F. Regression Analysis\n- Linear Regression provides a baseline performance but may not capture complex budget patterns.\n- Polynomial Regression improves performance slightly but introduces a risk of overfitting.\n- Ridge and Lasso Regression add regularization, preventing overfitting and improving generalization.\n- Bayesian Ridge Regression performs well in cases with high noise and uncertainty.\n- Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models outperform linear models by capturing nonlinear trends in budget outlays.\n- For future forecasting, ensemble methods such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are recommended.\n\n#### G. Time Series Analysis\n- Processed a random subset of 500 records to reduce memory consumption and avoid crashes.\n- ARIMA model successfully captured trends and fluctuations in the sampled dataset.\n- Holt-Winters smoothing effectively modeled trend and seasonal effects, making it useful for fiscal budget forecasting.\n- Both models provided reasonable forecasts for the next 5 years with lower computational cost.\n- Batched processing is an effective way to analyze large datasets without overwhelming memory.\n- For improved accuracy, forecasting models should be retrained annually with updated data to capture changing trends.\n\n#### Final Recommendations\n- For basic forecasting, ARIMA and Holt-Winters are effective, but they should be updated with new fiscal data annually.\n- For long-term trend prediction, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest are preferable due to their ability to handle nonlinear patterns.\n- Budgetary outlays do not follow a normal distribution, so feature scaling and transformations should be applied before modeling.\n- Batched data processing is a scalable way to analyze large datasets without memory overload.\n- A combination of time series models and regression models can provide the most accurate forecasts, especially for multi-year budget planning.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, BayesianRidge, ElasticNet\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing\n\n# Filter data for historical years (1962-2024)\ndf_long = df.melt(id_vars=['AgencyName', 'BureauName', 'AccountName'],\n                  value_vars=[col for col in df.columns if col.startswith('FY')],\n                  var_name='FiscalYear', value_name='Outlays')\n\n# Convert FiscalYear column to integer\ndf_long['FiscalYear'] = df_long['FiscalYear'].str.replace('FY', '').astype(int)\n\n# Select data for regression and time series\ndf_filtered = df_long[(df_long['FiscalYear'] >= 1962) & (df_long['FiscalYear'] <= 2024)]\n\n# Aggregate by FiscalYear\ndf_grouped = df_filtered.groupby('FiscalYear')['Outlays'].sum().reset_index()\n\n# Prepare training data\nX = df_grouped['FiscalYear'].values.reshape(-1, 1)\ny = df_grouped['Outlays'].values\n\n# Split into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Models for Regression Analysis\nmodels = {\n    \"Linear Regression\": LinearRegression(),\n    \"Multiple Regression\": LinearRegression(),\n    \"Polynomial Regression\": PolynomialFeatures(degree=2),\n    \"Ridge Regression\": Ridge(alpha=1.0),\n    \"Lasso Regression\": Lasso(alpha=0.1),\n    \"Bayesian Ridge Regression\": BayesianRidge(),\n    \"Gradient Boosting\": GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100),\n    \"Random Forest\": RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100),\n    \"ElasticNet\": ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)\n}\n\nresults = {}\n\n# Fit models and make predictions\nfor name, model in models.items():\n    if name == \"Polynomial Regression\":\n        poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)\n        X_poly_train = poly.fit_transform(X_train)\n        X_poly_test = poly.transform(X_test)\n        poly_reg = LinearRegression().fit(X_poly_train, y_train)\n        y_pred = poly_reg.predict(X_poly_test)\n    else:\n        model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n    #
