We will learn how to create a chain, add components to it, and run it. In this tutorial, we will cover: Using a simple LLM chain Creating sequential chains Creating a custom chain Why do we need chains?# Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components. Query an LLM with the LLMChain# The LLMChain is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM. To use the LLMChain, first create a prompt template. from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9) prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\"product\"], template=\"What is a good\n",
