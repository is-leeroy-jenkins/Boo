    "# Function calling for nearby places: Leveraging the Google Places API and customer profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is centered around the integration of the Google Places API and custom user profiles to enhance location-based searches. Our approach involves using the Google Places API in combination with user preferences, aiming to make location discovery more personal and relevant. Please note that while we focus on the Google Places API in this instance, there are numerous other APIs you could explore and apply in a similar fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the application of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer profile: This mock profile captures individual preferences for types of places (e.g., restaurants, parks, museums), budget, preferred ratings, and other specific requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Places API: This API provides real-time data about nearby places. It factors in various data points such as ratings, types of venues, costs, and more from the locations around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function calling: A single command such as \"I'm hungry\" or \"I want to visit a museum\" activates the function which combines the user profile data and Google Places API to identify suitable venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces two primary use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Profile-based recommendations: Learn how to create a user profile and make place recommendations based on individual preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- API integration with function calling: Understand how to integrate and call Google Places API effectively to source real-time data of various places using function calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that while this system is highly versatile, its effectiveness may vary based on user preferences and available place data. For the purposes of this notebook, the customer data is fake and the location is hardcoded. "
