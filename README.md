___

- **Boo** is a modular Python framework for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered assistants
tailored for federal data analysis, budget execution, and data science. It integrates OpenAI's GPT
models with multimodal support for text, image, audio, and file analysis. Designed with
extensibility and federal applications in mind, it enables secure, scalable, and intelligent
automation of analytical tasks.

## üìå Features

- **Unified AI Framework**: Integrates OpenAI APIs for text, image, audio, file analysis,
  transcription, and translation.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Supports text generation, image creation, image analysis, and
  document summarization.
- **Assistant Classes**:
   - `Chat`: Generic multimodal interaction with GPT.
   - `Assistant`: General-purpose assistant framework.
   - `Bubba`: Budget Execution Assistant.
   - `Bro`: Data Science & Programming Assistant.
- **Custom Fine-Tuned Models**: Uses proprietary fine-tuned models for different domains (e.g.,
  `bro-gpt`, `bubba-gpt`).
- **Vector Store Integration**: Embedded vector store lookups for domain-specific knowledge
  retrieval.
- **Web & File Search**: Built-in support for semantic document and web search.
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with UI support via `ErrorDialog`.
