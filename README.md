A modular Python framework for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered assistants
tailored for federal data analysis, budget execution, and data science. It integrates OpenAI's GPT
models with multimodal support for text, image, audio, and file analysis. Designed with
extensibility and federal applications in mind, it enables secure, scalable, and intelligent
automation of analytical tasks.
