during 1998, 1999, 2000, or 2001. For purposes of this
paragraph, the term ``total annual revenue'' means the revenue
earned in a single year from such stocks. The Secretary shall

contract between the United States and the person whose bid is
accepted, the performance of which shall be subject only to the
conclusion of a successful referendum, except that a person
whose bid is accepted by the Secretary under this section shall

licenses, fishery permits, area, and species endorsements, and
any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or vessels (or
to persons on the basis of their operation or ownership of that
vessel or vessels) removed under the program.
(g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan
sub-amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the
reduction fishery and for fish sellers in each of the fee-share
fisheries by dividing the total ex-vessel dollar value during
the bid scoring period of all reduction vessel landings from
the reduction fishery and from each of the fee-share fisheries
by the total such value of all such landings for all such
fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan amount by each of
the quotients resulting from each of the divisions above. Each
of the resulting products shall be the reduction loan sub-
amount for the reduction fishery and for each of the fee-share
fisheries to which each of such products pertains; except that,
each fish seller in the reduction fishery and in each of the
fee-share fisheries shall pay the fees required by the
reduction loan sub-amounts allocated to it under this
paragraph; except that, the Secretary may enter into agreements
with Washington, Oregon, and California to collect any fees
established under this paragraph.
(h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the
reduction loan's term shall not be less than 30 years.
(i) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of
Washington, Oregon, and California should revoke all
relinquishment permits in each of the fee-share fisheries
immediately after reduction payment, and otherwise to implement
appropriate State fisheries management and conservation
provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries that establishes
a program that meets the requirements of 16 U.S.C.
141861a(b)(1)(B) as if it were applicable to fee-share
fisheries.
(j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other
than the reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to vote
in a referendum for an industry fee system under paragraph (c).
The term ``reduction fishery'' means that portion of a fishery
holding limited entry fishing permits endorsed for the

existing standards and procedures on classification, and shall
provide a copy of such order to the Committees on
Appropriations.

and release of relevant information, all Federal agencies and
departments should use the discretion contained within such
existing standards and procedures on classification in support
of releasing, rather than withholding, such information.

Woods'' Program established in Region 10 of the Forest Service
to individuals and entities in historically timber-dependent
areas in the States of Washington, Oregon, northern California,

timber harvesting on Federal lands. The Secretaries shall
consider the benefits to the local economy in evaluating bids
and designing procurements which create economic opportunities
for local contractors.
Sec. 316. Amounts deposited during fiscal year 2002 in the
roads and trails fund provided for in the 14th paragraph under

were derived, to repair or reconstruct roads, bridges, and
trails on National Forest System lands or to carry out and
administer projects to improve forest health conditions, which
may include the repair or reconstruction of roads, bridges, and
trails on National Forest System lands in the wildland-
community interface where there is an abnormally high risk of
fire. The projects shall emphasize reducing risks to human
safety and public health and property and enhancing ecological

Sec. 318. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised
if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised usinga residual
value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for western
redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based on volume sold. Should
Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, the annual average portion of the
decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a
residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for western
redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from those sales which is
surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made
available to domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at
prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003,
less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale
quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which
are not deficit when appraised using a residual value approach that
assigns domestic Alaska values for western redcedar, the volume of
western redcedar timber available to domestic processors at prevailing
domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that
volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in
Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus western redcedar volume
determined by calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which
has been sold on the Tongass to the annual average portion of the
decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land
Management Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a
rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this amendment, a
``rolling basis'' shall mean that the determination of how much western
redcedar is eligible for sale to various markets shall be made at the
time each sale is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus
to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber sale
holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation of the
inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given sale to domestic
Alaska processors at a price equal to or greater than the log selling
value stated in the contract. All additional western redcedar volume
not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic processors
may be exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber sale
holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at prevailing export prices
at the election of the timber sale holder.
Sec. 319. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under
the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by
section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended,
shall not result in--
(1) displacement of the holder of an authorization
to provide commercial recreation services on Federal
lands. Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary
shall consult with potentially affected holders to
determine what impacts the project may have on the
holders. Any modifications to the authorization shall
be made within the terms and conditions of the
authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.
(2) the return of a commercial recreation service
to the Secretary for operation when such services have
been provided in the past by a private sector provider,
except when--
(A) the private sector provider fails to
bid on such opportunities;
(B) the private sector provider terminates
its relationship with the agency; or
(C) the agency revokes the permit for non-
compliance with the terms and conditions of the
authorization.
In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee
Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a
subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a new
prospectus.
Sec. 320. Prior to October 1, 2003, the Secretary of
Agriculture shall not be considered to be in violation of
subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable
Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) solely
because more than 15 years have passed without revision of the
plan for a unit of the National Forest System. Nothing in this
section exempts the Secretary from any other requirement of the
Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (16
U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other law: Provided, That if the
Secretary is not acting expeditiously and in good faith, within
the funding available, to revise a plan for a unit of the
National Forest System, this section shall be void with respect
to such plan and a court of proper jurisdiction may order
completion of the plan on an accelerated basis.

purpose described in such section includes the authority to use
that legal instrument when the principal purpose of the
resulting relationship is to the mutually significant benefit
of the Forest Service and the other party or parties to the
agreement, including nonprofit entities. An agreement entered
into under this section shall not be subject to Public Law 95-
224, Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (1977).
Sec. 322. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to
conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under either
the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) within the
boundaries of a National Monument established pursuant to the
Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) as such boundary
existed on January 20, 2001, except where such activities are
allowed under the Presidential proclamation establishing such
monument.

Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in
section 101(e) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 16 U.S.C.
2104 note), is amended--

2004'' and all that follows and inserting ``September

Management, via agreement or contract as appropriate,

private persons or other public or private entities to
perform services to achieve land management goals for
the national forests and the public lands that meet
local and rural community needs.'';

SEC. 502. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND DEFINITIONS.
(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
(1) Organizational camps, such as those
administered by the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and faith-
based and community-based organizations, provide a
valuable service to young people, individuals with a
disability, and their families by promoting physical,
mental, and spiritual health through activities
conducted in a natural environment.
(2) The 192,000,0000 acres of national forests and
grasslands of the National Forest System managed for
multiple uses by the Forest Service provide an ideal
setting for such organizational camps.
(3) The Federal Government should charge land use
fees for the occupancy and use of National Forest
System lands by such organizational camps that, while
based on the fair market value of the land in use, also
recognize the benefits provided to society by such
organizational camps, do not preclude the ability of
such organizational camps from utilizing these lands,
and permit capital investment in, and maintenance of,
camp facilities by such organizational camps or their
sponsoring organizations.
(4) Organizational camps should--
(A) ensure that their facilities meet
applicable building and safety codes, including
fire and health codes;
(B) have annual inspections as required by
local law, including at a minimum inspections
for fire and food safety; and
(C) have in place safety plans that address
fire and medical emergencies and encounters
with wildlife.
(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a
land use fee system that provides for an equitable return to
the Federal Government for the occupancy and use of National
Forest System lands by organizational camps that serve young
people or individuals with a disability.
(c) Definitions.--In this Act:
(1) The term ``organizational camp'' means a public
or semipublic camp that--

lands by a nonprofit organization or

public by using such lands as a setting to
introduce young people or individuals with a
disability to activities that they may not
otherwise experience and to educate them on
natural resource issues; and
(C) does not have as its primary purpose
raising revenue through commercial activities.
(2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of
Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest
Service.
(3) The term ``individual with a disability'' has
the meaning given the term in section 7(20) of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 705(20)).
(4) The term ``children at risk'' means children
who are raised in poverty or in single-parent homes or

company, the sale or transfer of a controlling
interest in the partnership or limited
liability company; and

Forest System lands authorized for the
organizational camp.
(B) The estimated per-acre market value of
land and buildings in the county where the camp
is located, as reported in the most recent
Census of Agriculture conducted by the National
Agricultural Statistics Service.
(2) Annual adjustment.--The land use fee determined
under paragraph (1) for an organizational camp shall be
adjusted annually by the annual compounded rate of
change between the two most recent Censuses of
Agriculture.
(3) Reduction in fees.--
(A) Type of participants.--The Secretary
shall reduce the land use fee determined under
paragraph (1) proportionate to the number of
individuals with a disability and children at
risk who annually attend the organizational
camp.
(B) Type of programs.--After making the
reduction required by subparagraph (A), the
Secretary shall reduce the remaining land use
fee amount by up to 60 percent, proportionate

the organizational camp who participate in
youth programs through organized and supervised
social, citizenship, character-building, or
faith-based activities oriented to outdoor-
recreation experiences.
(C) Relation to minimum fee.--The
reductions made under this paragraph may not
reduce the land use fee for an organizational
camp below the minimum land use fee required to
be charged under paragraph (4).

determined by the Secretary.
(2) Reduction in fees prohibited.--Notwithstanding
subsection (d), the facility use fees determined under
paragraph (1) shall not be subject to a reduction or
waiver.

organizational camp derives revenue from the use of National
Forest System lands or authorized facilities described in

people or individuals with a disability to activities that they

fee imposed under subsection (b), an additional fee equal to
five percent of that revenue.

distributed under paragraphs (1) and(2) and amounts
distributed under paragraphs (4) and (5) for Federal-aid highways and
highway safety construction programs (other than the minimum guarantee
program, but only to the extent that amounts apportioned for the
minimum guarantee program for such fiscal year exceed $2,639,000,000,
and the Appalachian development highway system program) that are
apportioned by the Secretary under title 23, United States Code, in the
ratio that--
(A) sums authorized to be appropriated for

such fiscal year).
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary shall
after August 1 for such fiscal year revise a distribution of
the obligation limitation made available under subsection (a)
if a State will not obligate the amount distributed during that

able to obligate amounts in addition to those previously
distributed during that fiscal year giving priority to those
States having large unobligated balances of funds apportioned
under sections 104 and 144 of title 23, United States Code,
section 160 (as in effect on the day before the enactment of
the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century) of title
23, United States Code, and under section 1015 of the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105
Stat. 1943-1945).

United States Code; and (2) that the Secretary determines will
not be allocated to the States, and will not be available for
obligation, in such fiscal year due to the imposition of any
obligation limitation for such fiscal year. Such distribution
to the States shall be made in the same ratio as the
distribution of obligation authority under subsection (a)(6).
The funds so distributed shall be available for any purposes
described in section 133(b) of title 23, United States Code.
(f) Obligation limitation distributed for a fiscal year
under subsection (a)(4) of this section for a section set forth

obligations for Federal-aid highway and highway safety
construction programs for future fiscal years.
Sec. 311. (a) No recipient of funds made available in this
Act shall disseminate personal information (as defined in 18
U.S.C. 2725(3)) obtained by a State department of motor
vehicles in connection with a motor vehicle record as defined
in 18 U.S.C. 2725(1), except as provided in 18 U.S.C. 2721 for
a use permitted under 18 U.S.C. 2721.

airport-aid program, airport development aid program or airport
improvement program grant: Provided, That, the FederalAviation
Administration shall accept such equipment, which shall thereafter be
operated and maintained by FAA in accordance with agency criteria.
Sec. 314. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and
except for fixed guideway modernization projects, funds made
available by this Act under ``Federal Transit Administration,

ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS, 2003
Congressional Directives
The statement of the managers remains silent on
provisions that were in both the House directives as contained
in H. Rept. 107-623, and the Senate directives as contained in
the Congressional Record of January 15, 2003, pages S356-S410,
that remain unchanged by this conference agreement, except as
noted in this statement of the managers.
For many years, this Act has included bill language
regarding the employment of temporary personnel as authorized
by 5 U.S.C. 3109 and/or 7 U.S.C. 2225. The conference agreement
does not include this language under individual accounts in
this Act, because it appears that this authority is no longer
required. In particular, this authority was not utilized by the
Farm Service Agency during fiscal year 2001, the most recent
year for which information was provided. The conferees agree to
provide authority to employ temporary personnel as a general
provision of this Act (section 703). The exercise of this
authority will require detailed justification, notification to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and advance
approval of the Committees.
The conferees agree that Federal Employees' Compensation
Act (FECA) costs be absorbed within appropriations provided
herein.
TITLE I--AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
Production, Processing, and Marketing
Office of the Secretary
The conference agreement provides $3,412,000 for the
Office of the Secretary as proposed by the Senate instead of
$31,629,000 as proposed by the House.
The conferees are seriously concerned by the growing
frequency of departmental and agency initiatives for which the
required prior notification to the Committees on Appropriations
of the House and Senate has not been provided. The conferees
note the efficiencies which attach to the least possible
statutory requirements and the benefits which accrue to the
more flexible Congressional direction expressed in Committee
reports. However, the continuing practice of reliance on
Committee report language must be accompanied by departmental
and agency compliance with Congressional directives. Section
720 of this Act, and similar language included in previous
acts, provide detailed guidelines to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for those activities that require prior
notification to the Congress. Such notification was not
provided in the recent release of Section 32 funds for the
creation of a Livestock Compensation Program, the establishment
of a Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Center, the improper
use of Conservation Operations funds for the implementation of
Farm Bill programs, and other similar violations of statutory
reprogramming and prior notification requirements. The
conferees expect full compliance with Section 720 in the areas
of state office collocations, administrative and information
technology convergence, and all other activities that fall
within the scope of that section. The conferees also expect
that no reprogramming of funds occur in the absence of an
emergency or not as a consequence of unforeseen events.
Further, the conferees note that when an agency submits a
reprogramming request to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations and does not receive identical responses from
the House and Senate, it is the responsibility of the agency to
reconcile the House and Senate differences before proceeding,
and if reconciliation is not possible, to consider the
reprogramming request unapproved.
The conferees are concerned that the U.S. and Canada made
little progress in implementing the harmonized standards for
pesticide regulation as required by the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The conferees direct USDA, in
consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, to
institute these standards so that concerns in the pricing of
agricultural products for the farmers will be addressed. The
conferees also direct USDA to report on the planned actions
taken to implement the harmonization standards to the
Committees on Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of
this Act.
Executive Operations
CHIEF ECONOMIST
The conference agreement provides $8,566,000 for the
Office of the Chief Economist as proposed by the House instead
of $12,016,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The President's budget request included additional
funding for the Website for Commodity Market Information,
Weather Information and Drought Management, and to Analyze
Critical Farm Energy Data. The conferees provide an increase of
$692,000 to be applied to the highest priority needs for which
additional funding was requested.

computing environment as proposed by both the House and Senate.
Office of the Chief Financial Officer
The conference agreement provides $5,572,000 for the
Office of the Chief Financial Officer as proposed by the House
instead of $7,877,000 as proposed by the Senate.
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
The conference agreement does not provide $41,000,000 for
the Working Capital Fund as proposed by the House. The Senate
bill contained no such provision. The conferees note that
$21,700,000 in fiscal year 2002 balances have been transferred
to the Working Capital Fund, and will be available to meet the
needs for which an appropriation was requested.
The conferees direct the Secretary of Agriculture to
submit a feasibility study to the Committees on Appropriations
on the need for remote mirroring backup technology of the
National Finance Center's data. This study should include a
breakdown of the costs and the timeframe associated with
acquiring such technology, and should designate an appropriate
physical location for the backup site. The study shall also
specify how the costs of the remote data capability should be
assigned and paid for by non-USDA users of the National Finance
Center, including the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment
Board. Upon approval by the Committees on Appropriations, the
funds appropriated to the Working Capital Fund shall be made
available to provide mirror imaging technology for the National
Finance Center.
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights
The conference agreement provides $400,000 for the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights as proposed by the
Senate. The House bill contained no such provision.
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration
The conference agreement provides $664,000 for the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for Administration as proposed by
the House instead of $780,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Agriculture Buildings and Facilities and Rental Payments
The conference agreement provides $196,781,000 for
agriculture buildings and facilities and rental payments
instead of $195,900,000 as proposed by the House and
$197,662,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The President's budget request includes additional
funding for the Fair Labor Standards and Service Contract Acts
and for major repairs and improvements to headquarters. The
conferees provide an increase of $881,000 to be applied to the
highest priority needs for which additional funding is
requested.
Hazardous Materials Management
The conference agreement provides $15,685,000 for
Hazardous Materials Management as proposed by the House and
Senate.
Departmental Administration
The conference agreement provides $38,095,000 for
Departmental Administration as proposed by the House instead of
$42,479,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations
The conference agreement provides $3,821,000 for the
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations
as proposed by the House instead of $4,157,000 as proposed by
the Senate.
Office of Communications
The conference agreement provides $9,140,000 for the
Office of Communications as proposed by the House instead of
$9,637,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees direct the Office to provide to the
Committees on Appropriations, in either electronic or facsimile
format, as requested, copies of any open source news material
made available to USDA officials that is purchased or otherwise
obtained using appropriated funds, amending licenses as
necessary.
Office of the Inspector General
The conference agreement provides $74,097,000 for the
Office of the Inspector General as proposed by the House
instead of $78,127,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement does not include increased funds
in this account for financial statement audits for the Food and
Nutrition Service and Rural Development programs, or the
increase requested for Forest Service audits. Funds for FNS and
RD audits are included in the accounts for those programs, as
requested.
Office of the General Counsel
The conference agreement provides $35,017,000 for the
Office of the General Counsel instead of $34,446,000 as
proposed by the House and $35,588,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees expect that increases provided above the
fiscal year 2002 level shall go toward highest priority items
contained in the fiscal year 2003 budget request.
Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics
The conference agreement provides $588,000 for the Office
of the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics as
proposed by the House instead of $780,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
Economic Research Service
The conference agreement provides $69,123,000 for the
Economic Research Service instead of $73,329,000 as proposed by
the House and $65,123,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees provide $5,000,000 for ERS to carry out
food and nutrition studies, of which $1,000,000 is for the
Small Research Grants Program. The conference agreement
provides full funding for the ERS portion of the Agricultural
Resource Management Survey.
The conferees are aware that the current primary
livestock model used by USDA has not been re-estimated in its
entirety since 1990 and much of the data used to develop this
model was from the 1960s and 1970s, long before packer
concentration, captive supplies and increasing imports. These
factors have had significant impacts on the livestock industry.
The conferees direct the Economic Research Service to update,
revise, and improve livestock modeling capacity.
The conferees are concerned that ERS appears to have
ceased publishing regional monthly production costs for dairy
farmers. These monthly production calculations are a valuable
tool and helpful to Congress in developing dairy policy. As
such the conferees strongly urge the Department to publish or
otherwise make available regional monthly production cost
calculations for dairy farmers.
The conferees request the Economic Research Service to
conduct a study of the Cranberry Marketing Committee and its
administration of the Cranberry Marketing Order and report to
the Committees on Appropriations by September 30, 2003. The
study shall focus on the economics of the cranberry industry
and the response of the Cranberry Marketing Committee to the
unprecedented losses incurred by cranberry growers since 1999.
The report of the study shall include recommendations to ensure
that the Cranberry Marketing Order is administered in a manner
that benefits cranberry growers and promotes the public
interest.
National Agricultural Statistics Service
The conference agreement provides $139,354,000 for the
National Agricultural Statistics Service instead of
$137,858,000 as proposed by the House and $140,854,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes full funding for the
NASS portion of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey,
and $1,500,000 for e-government activities.
Agricultural Research Service

fiscal year 2002 regular appropriation. The conference
agreement also provides an increase of $6,227,000 in device
user fees for the biologics program. The conferees expect that
these substantial investments will significantly reduce
application review times for medical devices.
The conference agreement funds the generic drugs program
at $44,532,000, an increase of $5,332,000 over the fiscal year
2002 level, and expect the increase provided to be applied to
meeting statutory timeframes for application review. The
generics total includes $750,000 above the budget request,
instead of $1,500,000 as proposed by the Senate and no increase
above the request as proposed by the House. The conferees note
that FDA should continue funding generic drug education
activities at no less than $400,000 and expect increased
consumer education in 2003.
The conference agreement makes $222,900,000 available to
FDA for prescription drug user fees, a $61,184,000 increase
over the amount available in fiscal year 2002. The conference
agreement also makes mammography user fees and export
certification user fees available to the agency.
The conferees do not approve the proposed transfer of the
Offices of Public Affairs and Legislative Affairs out of the
agency and include funding for those offices in the total
provided for this account.
The conferees note the importance of continued support
for the Office of Women's Health, and direct that no less than
$3,000,000 be made available to that office. In addition, the
conferees note that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
responded to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) by
recommending updated labeling for the entire class of hormone
replacement therapy products. While the conferees believe that
the FDA's action was an important step in the right direction,
the Federal government needs to go even further in
communicating clear and concise information to women and health
professionals about hormone therapy. The conferees encourage
the FDA to partner with medical professional and women's health
groups, as well as other Federal agencies, to conduct a public
awareness outreach campaign about the use of hormone therapy,
including treatment of menopausal symptoms, which was not
addressed in the WHI study.
The conferees provide an increase of $1,000,000 for the
CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS), instead of no
increase as proposed by the House and $2,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate, for a total of $6,600,000. CAERS is designed to
ensure prompt identification of and response to adverse health
events related to foods, including dietary supplements.
The conference agreement also provides an increase of
$250,000 for development of advanced test methods for foods at
New Mexico State University, instead of no increase as proposed
by the House and $503,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes a total of $8,300,000
for the Unified Financial Management System, as proposed by
both the House and Senate. Theconferees note that any
additional resources for this system are subject to notification and
approval by the Committees on Appropriations.
The conferees direct that at least $2,100,000 of the
funds appropriated for FDA activities be used in support of
Codex Alimentarius activities, as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees are aware that the Department of Health and
Human Services is currently working to ensure that health care
providers and first responders are vaccinated in the event of a
public health emergency. Recognizing that a small percentage of
the population may have an allergic reaction to natural rubber,
the conferees encourage the Secretary to ensure that
alternatives are readily accessible to those individuals
allergic to the gloves normally provided. Additionally, the
conferees are aware that the FDA proposed regulations in 1999
to reclassify all surgeons' and patient examination gloves as
Class II medical devices. The conferees encourage the FDA to
finalize those regulations.
The conferees are aware that the FDA has not finalized
its proposed rule to require manufacturer tracking of blood-
derived products and prompt patient notification of adverse
events, and request a report on the status of the rule by March
1, 2003.
The conferees are aware of concerns regarding the sale of
turtles as pets. The occurrence of Salmonella is frequent in
all reptiles sold as pets, yet the FDA has banned only the sale
of turtles under a certain size. The conferees expect the
agency to respond to citizen petitions on this topic promptly.
The conferees expect a report by March 1, 2003, describing the
current regulation, and the status of the agency's response to
related citizen petitions.
The conferees believe that print advertisements for
pharmaceuticals should present information relating to side
effects, contraindications and the effectiveness of advertised
pharmaceuticals in the format that is most useful to consumers
consistent with existing law. The conferees are aware that FDA
addressed the issue of requirements for print drug
advertisements in an April 2001 draft guidance. The conferees
encourage FDA to work with consumers and industry to revise
this draft guidance as necessary and move towards its
finalization.
The conferees are concerned with the number of
reprogramming proposals submitted for consideration by the FDA,
and would like to remind the Agency that reprogramming requests
should be submitted only in the case of an unforeseeable
emergency, or situation that could not have been predicted when
formulating the budget request for the current fiscal year.
Further, the conferees note that when an agency submits a
reprogramming request to the Committees on Appropriations and
does not receive identical responses from the House and Senate,
it is the responsibility of the agency to reconcile the House
and Senate differences before proceeding, and if reconciliation
is not possible, to consider the reprogramming request
unapproved.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
The conference agreement includes $8,000,000 for
buildings and facilities, as proposed by the House, instead of
$11,000,000, as proposed by the Senate. The conference
agreement fully funds the budget request.
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
The conference agreement provides $85,985,000 for the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, instead of $79,884,000 as
proposed by the House and $93,985,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The total includes $8,815,000 for pay parity, as
authorized in P.L. 107-171, and $700,000 for retention bonuses.
The conferees understand that the Commission has
undertaken an investigation of Enron, its affiliates, and
energy trading by other entities, which has required
significant resources from the agency's enforcement program.
The conferees further understand that the agency's enforcement
staff has devoted the resources of 30 staff members (which is
equivalent to 25 percent of the staff for the Division of
Enforcement), interviewed or taken testimony from at least 170
individuals, and reviewed in excess of 2 million pages of
documents. The conferees direct the Commission to provide a
report on its activities in this area prior to the fiscal year
2004 appropriations hearings.
Farm Credit Administration
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes a limitation of
$38,400,000 on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit
Administration (FCA), as proposed by the House, instead of
$38,404,000, as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees recommend an increase in the limitation of
FCA's administrative expenses to allow the FCA flexibility to
deal with hiring and retention issues. This flexibility would
allow the FCA Board to make adjustments to the budget, if
necessary. The conferees understand that this action will not
result in an increase in the amount of assessments on system
institutions during the current fiscal year. The conferees
request a report on the outcome of the FCA study related to
hiring and retention needs, including the actual limitation
amount necessary, the amount of carryover funds in FCA's
reserve, and the change, if any, in the amount of the
assessments on system institutions.
TITLE VII--GENERAL PROVISIONS
House and Senate Section 703.--The conference agreement
deletes the old Section 703 authorizing research and service
work under the Bankhead-Jones Act.
House Section 736.--The conference agreement (Section
703) authorizes employment pursuant to the Department of
Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 and 5 U.S.C. 3109.
House and Senate Section 704.--The conference agreement
(Section 704) retains the existing general provision regarding
unobligated balance transfers to the Working Capital Fund.
House and Senate Section 705.--New obligational authority
language.
House and Senate Section 713.--The conference agreement
(Section 713) gives permanent authority to the Agricultural
Marketing Service, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard
Administration, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
and the Food Safety & Inspection Service to use cooperative
agreements, notwithstanding chapter 63 of title 31, United
States Code.
House and Senate Section 720.--The conference agreement
(Section 720) modifies Subsection (c) to include ``the
Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, or the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.'' The conferees are seriously concerned by the
growing frequency of departmental and agency initiatives for
which the required prior notification to the Committees on
Appropriations has not been provided. The conferees note the
efficiencies which attach to the least possible statutory
requirements and the benefits which accrue to the more flexible
Congressional direction expressed in Committee reports.
However, the continuing practice of reliance on Committee
report language must be accompanied by departmental and agency
compliance with Congressional directives. Section 720 of this
Act, and similar language included in previous acts, provide
detailed guidelines to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission for those activities that require prior notification
to the Congress. Such notification was not provided in the
recent release of Section 32 funds for the creation of a
Livestock Compensation Program; the establishment of a Faith-
Based and Community Initiatives Center; the improper use of
Conservation Operations funds for the implementation of Farm
Bill programs; and other similar violations of statutory
reprogramming and prior notification requirements. The
conferees expect full compliance with Section 720 in the areas
of state office collocations, administrative and information
technology convergence, and all other activities that fall
within the scope of that section. The conferees also expect
that no reprogramming of funds occur in the absence of an
emergency or not as a consequence of unforeseen events.
Further, the conferees note that when an agency submits a
reprogramming request to the Committees on Appropriations and
does not receive identical responses from the House and Senate,
it is the responsibility of the agency to reconcile the House
and Senate differences before proceeding, and if reconciliation
is not possible, to consider the reprogramming request
unapproved.
House and Senate Section 721.--The conference agreement
(Section 721) does not include the date change as proposed by

(Section 722) does not include the date change as proposed by
the House.

732) adds language that allows any current Rural Utilities
Service borrower within 100 miles of New York City to be
eligible for additional financing, refinancing, collateral
flexibility, and deferrals.

the amount provided to carry out a competitive grants program
under section 401 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and
Education Reform Act of 1998.
Senate Section 736.--The conference agreement (Section

technical assistance to the Upper Tygart Valley Watershed, to
include 100 percent of the engineering assistance and 75

the salaries of personnel to carry out section 6405 of Public
Law 107-171.
Senate Section 741.--The conference agreement (Section
743) prohibits the use of funds appropriated by this Act to pay
the salaries of personnel to carry out section 9010 of P.L.

otherwise be paid to eligible producers.
Senate Sections 742 and 743.--The conference agreement
(Section 744) combines these sections and authorizes watershed
and flood prevention operations financial and technical

include language regarding citrus canker. This matter is
addressed in Division N of this conference agreement.
House Section 739.--The conference agreement does not
include House Section 739 regarding the release of sensitive
information. The Senate had no similar provision. The conferees
fully expect that all departments and agencies for which
funding is made available by this Act give careful scrutiny to
the release of information in order to ensure adequate
protections are maintained for all departmental and agency
personnel. The conferees do not imply that there should be a
disruption of routine agency reporting of program activities
directed either through statute or agency practice, but that
general safeguards should be in place to ensure security for
all facilities and personnel.
House Section 740.--The conference agreement (Section
755) makes the municipality of Carolina, Puerto Rico, eligible

justified prior to any expenditure of funds.
House Section 742.--The conference agreement (Section
757) authorizes the Agricultural Marketing Service and the

agreement (Section 765) includes language regarding the
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938.
Senate Section 761.--The conference agreement does not
include language expressing the Sense of the Senate regarding
conservation technical assistance. The House had no similar
provision. The conferees very strongly concur with an opinion
issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on October 8,
2002, that conservation technical assistance for a number of
Farm Bill conservation programs should be provided from funds
of the Commodity Credit Corporation and that use of
Conservation Operations appropriations for that purpose is
contrary to law. Elsewhere in this Act, language is provided
consistent with the legal finding of the GAO on this issue. The
conferees direct the Administration to reconsider immediately
its position in order to prevent USDA from being responsible
for making impossible the delivery of conservation programs
necessary for protection of this nation's natural resources.
Senate Section 762.--The conference agreement (Section
766) extends the time period for certain Rural Housing Service
funds.
Senate Section 763.--The conference agreement includes
language (Section 767) relating to corn acreage.
Senate Section 764.--The conference agreement does not
include Senate section 764 expressing the Sense of the Senate
regarding international humanitarian food assistance. The
conferees note the worsening conditions in many nations where
adverse weather, social upheaval, warfare, and other causes
have placed millions of people in dire threat of starvation. In
addition, increased commodity prices have further strained the
resources for food aid made available through direct
appropriations. The conferees direct the Secretary of
Agriculture to give immediate attention to the growing risk and
reality of this global tragedy, as witnessed in Africa and
other continents, and make use of existing authorities of the
Commodity Credit Corporation to assist in food assistance to
those areas. In addition, the Secretary should consult with the
President on the need to submit an emergency supplemental
request to the Congress to make additional resources available
for this purpose.
Senate Section 765.--The conference agreement does not
include language on the sale of milk into California.
The conference agreement (Section 768) rescinds
$11,000,000 of fiscal year 2002 and prior year funds out of
section 523(b)(1)(A) of the Housing Act of 1949.
The conference agreement (Section 769) provides that the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) shall be exempt from the across-the-board
rescission under section 601 of division N.
The conference agreement (Section 770) includes language
regarding grain warehouses.
The conference agreement (Section 771) includes language
regarding organic standards for meat.

DIVISION B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2003
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
General Administration
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement recommends a total of
$100,579,000 for General Administration for fiscal year 2003.
This account supports the development of policy objectives and
the overall management of the Department of Justice. The
recommendation provides inflationary adjustments to maintain
the current operating level in fiscal year 2003, and includes
an increase of $2,000,000 as requested for the Office of
Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) to address the increase
in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests. The
conferees expect OIPR to provide quarterly briefings to the
Committees on Appropriations beginning April 1, 2003 on FISA-
related activities, issues, and compliance with Congressional
directives. The conferees expect that of the funding being
transferred to the Department of Homeland Security from General
Administration, that $3,000,000 shall be used for the chemical
plant vulnerability assessments as authorized under Public Law
106-40.
The conferees direct the Justice Department to submit a
report to the Committees on Appropriations by June 27, 2003
assessing physical security needs of all domestic and foreign
installations. The conferees also direct the Attorney General
to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than June 4, 2003, that includes cost estimates and timelines
for developing an International Law Enforcement training
academy in Mexico in one of the following states: Chiapas,
Durango, Oaxaca, or Yucatan.
The conferees are aware that the Justice Department
intends to cap the reimbursement per employee for professional
liability insurance (PLI) at $50, a cut of up to $65, due to
``budget shortfalls''. The conferees are unaware of any
shortfalls. The Justice Department is directed to reimburse
employees for the full amount policy allows for PLI. The
Assistant Attorney General for Administration is directed to
issue a circular to components to that effect and to confirm by
letter, with circular attached, to the Committees on
Appropriations that this directive has been implemented.
The conferees are not satisfied with the efforts of the
Justice Department and the State Department to repatriate
criminal aliens. A recent Supreme Court decision held that
criminal aliens cannot be detained indefinitely. The conferees
are concerned that potentially violent criminal aliens will be
released into the United States because efforts to repatriate
these individuals have been unsuccessful. The conferees
therefore include bill language directing the Attorney General
to notify the Secretary of State in each instance when a
foreign country denies or unreasonably delays, under section
243 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the repatriation of
a criminal alien who is a citizen, subject, national or
resident of that country. The conferees believe that this
language will equip the Secretary of State and the Attorney
General with the legal authority to prevent the release of
violent criminal aliens in the United States.
The conferees support the Department's efforts to develop
a unified financial management system which will bring the
Justice Department into compliance with Federal Financial
Management Improvement Act accounting system standards and
security requirements. The conferees are aware that the unified
financial management system is an eligible purpose for retained
earnings in the Working Capital Fund and direct the Justice
Department to use $8,900,000 in retained earnings during FY
2003 for this purpose. The conferees believe that Working
Capital Fund retained earnings should be used for specific
projects rather than being used to meet recurring costs, such
as audit contract expenses.
Consistent with the report submitted to the Committees on
Appropriations in May 2002 regarding the number of containers
used for storage of classified information, the conference
agreement includes necessary sums to continue efforts to
replace locks used to store classified information.
The Department is directed to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations by June 1, 2003 regarding the
feasibility of making Foreign Agents Registration Act
information available on line to the public, as is data from
the Lobbying Disclosure Act.
The conferees remind the Department and its components
that the use of recoveries is subject to the requirements
included in section 605 of this Act.
The conferees include bill language carried in previous
years regarding the position and workyear limits for the
Offices of Public Affairs and Legislative Affairs, and include
language, carried in previous years, which (1) makes up to
$3,317,000 of this appropriation available until expended for
the Departmental building, renovation, maintenance, and
security needs; (2) specifies the amount of funding provided
for the Department Leadership Office; and (3) authorizes the
Attorney General to transfer property to state or local
government agencies to support community-based health and
safety programs.
JOINT AUTOMATED BOOKING SYSTEM
The conference agreement includes $15,973,000 for the
continued deployment of a Joint Automated Booking System
(JABS). The conferees have not adopted the Administration's
request to combine JABS activities with the ongoing integration
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's IDENT
fingerprint system with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
IAFIS fingerprint system (IDENT/IAFIS). Funding for IDENT/IAFIS
activities is provided under a separate account. The conferees
expect JABS incentive funds to be distributed to the component
or components making the best progress in installing and
operating the system.
This funding level enables Justice Department law
enforcement components--the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration,
and the Bureau of Prisons--to share arrest information using a
common information technology platform. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, now part of the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), is directed to continue participating in JABS.
The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations by
June 27, 2003 to determine if other DHS law enforcement
components should participate in JABS. The report should
include expected operations and maintenance costs, and an
assessment of whether state and local law enforcement agencies
should have access to JABS. JABS is a secure information system
that has automated the booking process, allowing law
enforcement agencies to electronically share criminal data to
improve criminal identification response times and avoid
duplication of booking data entry.
AUTOMATED BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM/INTEGRATED IDENTIFICATION
SYSTEM INTEGRATION
The conferees recommend $9,000,000 for continued
integration of the FBI Automated Biometric Identification
System and the INS Integrated Automated Fingerprint
Identification Systems (IDENT/IAFIS). As noted previously, the
conferees do not adopt the Administration's request to
establish an Identification Systems Integration account. Of the
amount provided, $1,000,000 is for a pilot program for software
for IAFIS that is capable of expedited background checks and
that is capable of ten fingerprint to less than ten fingerprint
comparisons. This funding level will enable IDENT/IAFIS to be
deployed to additional sites, and will provide other
refinements to, and planning for, the system. The Department of
Justice, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland (DHS),
is directed to provide a cost and operational effectiveness
analysis, complete with implementation milestones, to the
Committees on Appropriations by June 27, 2003. This report
should determine if other DHS law enforcement components should
participate in this ongoing integration effort.
LEGAL ACTIVITIES OFFICE AUTOMATION
The conference agreement includes $15,942,000 in direct
appropriations for Legal Activities Office Automation (LAOA).
In addition, the conferees direct that an additional
$61,185,000 be derived from a transfer from the Working Capital
Fund, to provide a total of $77,127,000 for LAOA activities.
This account centrally funds the acquisition, deployment,
and maintenance of Legal Activities Office Automation (LAOA)
systems, the largest components of which are the Justice
Consolidated Network and the Justice Consolidated Office
Network. Funding provided supports ongoing computer
modernization programs for the legal divisions, including the
Antitrust Division, the Executive Office for Immigration
Review, the Community Relations Service, and General Legal
Activities. This year, the conference agreement directs that
the Bureau of Prisons and Office of Justice Programs begin
efforts to migrate onto this network.
The conference agreement includes bill language to
provide for expenses related to design, development,
engineering, acquisition, and implementation of office
automation systems. The recommendation also includes language
modified from language carried in previous Appropriations acts
regarding the list of participating components.
NARROWBAND COMMUNICATIONS
The conference agreement includes a total of $101,757,000
for Narrowband Communications, including direct appropriations
of $81,354,000 and $20,403,000 in recoveries. The conferees
note that $68,043,000 remains unobligated in this account from
prior year appropriations, and that funds for new and
replacement radios and related costs are also provided in the
modular costs allotted to each of the law enforcement
components. New bill language is included directing the
Attorney General to transfer these modular costs to the
Narrowband account to ensure that funding provided for radios
is not diverted for other uses.
The conferees expect the Department to continue
implementation of a consolidated, interagency Justice Wireless
Network (JWN) to meet component needs and improve wireless
capabilities, as such an approach will enhance interoperability
and reduce costs associated with narrowband conversion. Amounts
provided will be used to continue implementation of the JWN,
operate and maintain legacy systems, expand the use of
commercial services, and support the Wireless Management Office
(WMO). The conferees continue to expect the Department to
accommodate narrowband requirements without significant
additional new resources. The conferees direct the WMO to
continue to submit status reports to the Committee as directed
in Public Law 106-553, to include an operational plan for
expenditure of funds.
The Department shall provide a report to the Committees
on Appropriations by June 27, 2003 regarding the use of radios
and any deficiencies noted by Justice law enforcement
components during the events of September 11, 2001. The
conferees continue to support extensive efforts underway at the
Office of Justice Programs regarding the interoperability of
State and local law enforcement radios. The Department is
directed to determine, in coordination with the National
Institute of Justice, if there are interoperability solutions
that have been developed for state and local law enforcement
that could be applicable to Federal law enforcement
communication needs. No funding is provided under this account
for the Public Safety Wireless Information Network (PSWIN).
Instead, the conferees expect the Department's participation in
the PSWIN program and Project SAFECOM to be funded within the
resources provided under the Office of Justice Programs, after
consultation with the Committees on Appropriations.
The conferees recommend bill language, as carried in
previous years, regarding the costs of conversion to narrowband
communications, and the costs of operating and maintaining land
mobile radio legacy systems.
COUNTERTERRORISM FUND
The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the
Counterterrorism Fund to cover extraordinary costs associated
with a terrorist threat or incident. This level, when combined
with current unobligated balances and recoveries of
$49,281,000, ensures a total level of $50,281,000 for fiscal
year 2003.
The Counterterrorism Fund was established in the 1995
Supplemental Appropriations Act after the bombing of the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and is under the
control and direction of the Attorney General. These funds may
be used to reimburse any Department of Justice organization for
the costs incurred from the reestablishment of an office or
facility damaged or destroyed as a result of a domestic or
international terrorist incident, and to cover extraordinary
expenses necessary to counter, investigate, or prosecute
domestic or international terrorism activities. The Attorney
General is required to notify the Committees on Appropriations
in accordance with section 605 of this Act prior to obligation
of any funds from this account.
The conferees recommend bill language, carried in
previous Appropriations acts, which makes funds available: (1)
for costs incurred in reestablishing the operational capacity
of an office or facility damaged or destroyed by a terrorist
incident; and (2) for support to counter, investigate, or
prosecute terrorism, including payments of rewards and
detention costs in connection with these activities.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND APPEALS
The conference agreement includes $191,535,000 for
Administrative Review and Appeals. Of the total amount
provided, $189,713,000 is for the Executive Office of
Immigration Review (EOIR), and $1,822,000 is for the Pardon
Attorney. This level includes an increase of $8,000,000 to
address the growing immigration judge workload as a result of
increases in Immigration and Naturalization Service enforcement
activities.
The Attorney General is directed to submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations by April 30, 2003, regarding
the implementation of the changes to the Bureau of Immigration
Appeals process announced by the Attorney General August 23,
2002.
This appropriation supports the EOIR, which includes the
Board of Immigration Appeals, Immigration Judges, and
Administrative Law Judges who decide through administrative
hearings on the admission or exclusion of aliens seeking to
enter the country, and the transportation and adjustment of
status of aliens whose status has been challenged; and the
Office of the Pardon Attorney, which receives, investigates and
considers petitions for all forms of Executive clemency.
DETENTION TRUSTEE
The conference agreement includes $1,366,591,000 for the
Federal Detention Trustee. This amount includes transfers of
$592,985,000 from the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and $773,606,000 from the Federal Prisoner Detention account.
Within 45 days of enactment of this Act, the Trustee is
directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations
regarding the appropriateness of transferring to the Trustee
any U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Naturalization
Service personnel involved in procuring detention space.
The conferees are aware that a number of States have
excess prison capacity. Therefore, the Detention Trustee is
directed to use existing State prison capacity if it meets
Federal standards and is cost effective. In addition, the
conferees direct the Detention Trustee, in collaboration with
the Bureau of Prisons and the Office of Justice Programs, to
submit a plan to the Committees on Appropriations by April 30,
2003, to evaluate the health and safety of Federal prisoners in
non-Federal institutions. The conferees also urge the Detention
Trustee to continue its efforts with the Federal Judicial
Center regarding alternatives to detention.
The recommendation also includes $1,000,000 for
development of the National Repository. The conferees direct
the Department's Chief Information Officer to assist the
Detention Trustee in establishing this clearinghouse as quickly
as possible. The Committees on Appropriations expect to be
regularly briefed on progress in establishing this repository.
The Detention Trustee shall report to the Committees on
Appropriations regarding its aircraft replacement procurement
strategy not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act.
Section 114 of Public Law 106-113 directs that health
care services provided for individuals in the custody of the
U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) shall not exceed the lesser of the
amount that would be paid for a similar service under Medicare
and Medicaid. The conferees direct the Detention Trustee to
review the impact that this language has had on the delivery of
health care services. The review shall include: (1) an analysis
of the cost of providing health care to individuals in USMS and
INS custody of the Federal Prison System, including
transportation and security costs; (2) the impact section 114
has had on the availability of the health care services
throughout the country to individuals in the custody of the
Department; and (3) any recommended changes to USMS, INS, FPS
policies to ensure that individuals in the custody of the
Department have access to necessary health care services at
affordable rates. The conferees expect that the study will be
funded by the affected components. The Detention Trustee shall
submit its review to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than 180 days after the enactment of this Act.
The conferees include bill language, modified from the
request, which provides for the transfer of funding from the
Detention Trustee to the USMS or to the Immigration Enforcement
and Border Affairs account. The Committee also (1) recommends
language carried in previous years regarding the authorities of
the Detention Trustee; (2) modifies language previously carried
regarding the construction of detention facilities; (3)
provides that unobligated balances available in prior years
from funds appropriated to the Federal Prisoner Detention
account be transferred to the Detention Trustee account; and
(4) directs that the Detention Trustee and the Bureau of
Prisons develop a plan for evaluating the health and safety of
Federal prisoners in non-Federal facilities.
Office of Inspector General
The conference agreement includes $57,937,000 for the
Office of Inspector General. The recommended level includes a
$2,000,000 increase to address additional responsibilities
resulting from P.L. 107-56.
The Office of Inspector General conducts and supervises
audits and investigations relating to the programs and
operations of the Department of Justice, and keeps the Attorney
General and Congress informed about problems and deficiencies
relating to the administration of such programs and activities.
As the Nation's chief law enforcement agency, it is essential
that the motives and actions of the Justice Department be above
reproach. The conferees urge the Inspector General to be
sensitive to such concerns and to continue to ensure the
integrity and fairness of Justice Department management
processes and Federal law enforcement efforts.
The conference agreement includes bill language providing
up to $10,000 to meet unforeseen emergencies and for the
acquisition and operation of motor vehicles.
United States Parole Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $10,488,000 for the
U.S. Parole Commission for fiscal year 2003.
The Commission is an independent body within the
Department of Justice that makes decisions regarding requests
for parole and supervision of Federal and District of Columbia
(D.C.) Code prisoners. As a result of legislation that
established sentencing guidelines, the Parole Commission is
phasing down its Federal operations. In August 1998, the
Commission assumed jurisdiction over D.C. felony prisoners and
D.C. Code parolees. When the D.C. Board of Parole ceased to
exist, the Commission inherited a parole revocation caseload
with a significant backlog of warrant requests and revocation
hearings. In a May 2002 report to the Committee, the Attorney
General reported that the Commission is responsible for
conducting hearings and making parole decisions for over 3,000
Federal inmates; supervising about 4,000 Federal offenders
currently on parole; and rendering parole revocation decisions
for nearly 1,000 Federal offenders every year. The Commission
also conducts hearings and adjudicates parole decisions for
more than 7,000 eligible D.C. offenders who committed their
crimes before August 5, 2000.
Legal Activities
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, GENERAL LEGAL ACTIVITIES
The conference agreement includes $611,325,000 for
General Legal Activities for fiscal year 2003. This
appropriation supports the Attorney General through the
establishment of litigation policy, conduct of litigation, and
various other legal responsibilities. The distribution of
funding provided is as follows. The conferees remind the legal
divisions that changes to these levels are subject to section
605 requirements in this Act.

____________________________________________________
Total.............................................    $611,325
Criminal Division.--The conference agreement provides a
total of $129,766,000, 810 positions and 822 workyears for the
Criminal Division, to address cyber-terrorism, foreign legal
assistance, foreign counterintelligence, and white collar
crime. The Criminal Division is directed to submit a report to
the Committee by May 2, 2003, on the $4,800,000 enhancement
provided in Public Law 107-117 to coordinate international
legal activities related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks.
Civil Division.--The recommendation provides a total of
$207,718,000, 1,042 positions and 1,063 workyears for the Civil
Division. Included in this amount is an increase of $10,000,000
for administrative expenses associated with the September 11th
Victim Compensation program. The conferees direct the Office of
the Special Master and the Civil Division to submit a report to
the Committee by July 7, 2003 containing an update on the
status of awards provided from the September 11th Victims
Compensation Fund.
The conferees include bill language carried in previous
Appropriations acts allowing the Attorney General to provide
additional resources to the Civil Division, if emergent
circumstances warrant, through transfers of funds from other
Department of Justice sources. The conference agreement
includes $23,388,000 in funding available to the Department
through the Working Capital Fund for the requested tobacco and
other litigation activities. The conferees also include
$1,996,000 for administrative expenses associated with the
Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) of 1990, as amended.
This program was established, in accordance with RECA, to
permit the payment of claims to individuals exposed to
radiation as a result of atmospheric nuclear tests and uranium
mining. Previously, these funds had been appropriated under a
separate account. New language is included in this bill
reflecting that funding is now being provided under the Civil
Division. The conferees expect the Civil Division to absorb any
additional requirements for processing RECA claims from other
resources available to the Civil Division.
The conferees do not include requested programmatic
increases for the Commercial Litigation section. Any additional
requirements may be covered within existing resources through
the regular reprogramming process. The funding level
recommended for the Civil Division includes the requested
reduction of $1,762,000, reflecting improvements achieved as a
result of the Torts Litigation Division's use of automated
litigation support.
Civil Rights Division.--The conferees include
$105,099,000, 753 positions and 755 workyears, the full amount
requested, for the Civil Rights Division to enforce voting
rights, disability rights, and other civil rights policies.
Trafficking.--An estimated 1 to 2 million people are
trafficked each year worldwide, with women and children making
up at least 700,000 of this total. It is estimated that 50,000
of these women and children are trafficked into the United
States annually by crime rings and loosely connected criminal
networks. The Department of Justice is directed to provide a
report to the Committees on Appropriations by May 9, 2003,
regarding the Department's litigation and law enforcement
efforts to combat trafficking in persons.
Courtroom technology.--The amounts provided include
$5,200,000 for courtroom technology to be distributed among the
divisions on the basis of need.
The conference agreement includes bill language, similar
to that included in previous fiscal years, which: (1) allows up
to $20,000 for expenses of collecting evidence; (2) makes up to
$10,000,000 for litigation support contracts available until
expended; (3) makes up to $1,000 available to the INTERPOL-
USNCB for reception and representation expenses; and (4) allows
the Attorney General to transfer funds to address emergent
circumstances in the Civil Division. The conferees also
recommend bill language, included in previous Appropriations
acts under a separate heading, for administrative expenses in
accordance with RECA. The recommendation does not include
requested bill language making a portion of funds for certain
activities available until expended.
THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT
The conference agreement includes a reimbursement of
$4,028,000 for fiscal year 2003 from the Vaccine Injury
Compensation Trust Fund to cover the Department of Justice's
expenses associated with litigating cases under the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, ANTITRUST DIVISION
The conference agreement provides $133,133,000 for the
Antitrust Division as proposed by the Senate, instead of
$134,295,000 as proposed by the House. This amount will be
offset with Hart-Scott-Rodino fee collections, regardless of
the year of collection, resulting in no direct appropriations.
The Conferees understand that due to changes in the Hart-
Scott-Rodino fee structure and a reduction in merger activity
that the number of pre-merger filings requiring review declined
by 76 percent between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2002. In
light of this decline in filings, the Conferees direct the
Antitrust Division to submit a financial and performance plan
to the Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of enactment
of this Act. The plan shall outline how the Division intends to
vigorously enforce our nation's antitrust laws.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS
The conference agreement provides $1,503,767,000 for the
U.S. Attorneys. This appropriation supports the Executive
Office of U.S. Attorneys and the 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices,
which serve as the principal litigators for the U.S. Government
for criminal, civil, and debt collection matters.
Corporate Fraud.--To aggressively prosecute cases of
corporate fraud, the conference agreement includes an increase
of $13,000,000 to support the Justice Department's Corporate
Fraud Task Force.
Intermodal Security Pilot Project.--The conferees
recommend $5,000,000 for Project Seahawk, an Intermodal
Security pilot project, to be coordinated by the Office of the
U.S. Attorneys. The U.S. Attorneys are directed to provide a
spend plan to the Committees on Appropriations not later than
March 15, 2003.
Legal Education.--The conference agreement provides
$18,842,000 for legal education and distance learning at the
National Advocacy Center (NAC), and if merited, the NAC may
expand or include antiterrorism, cybercrime and financial
investigation classes. The conferees also include an increase
of $6,000,000 to expand distance learning capabilities at the
NAC.
U.S. Attorneys Anti-Terrorism Task Forces.--The conferees
note that the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which were
established in 1980 and have since grown to be active in each
of the 56 FBI field offices, include representatives of local,
State, and Federal law enforcement, including U.S. Attorneys,
as well as other relevant participants from each community. The
conferees believe that the Joint Terrorism Task Forces should
play the lead Federal coordinating role with respect to multi-
agency counterterrorism efforts, and that the U.S. Attorneys
should continue to participate in these Task Forces rather than
maintain a separate set of U.S. Attorneys task forces.
Violent crime task forces.--The conference agreement
includes an additional $1,500,000 within available resources to
continue and expand task force activities associated with
Operation Streetsweeper.
Cybercrime and Intellectual Property Enforcement.--
Twenty-five percent of the software produced in the United
States has been copied illegally in violation of U.S. copyright
laws. The estimate of lost revenue to such industries exceeds
$300 billion annually. Therefore, the agreement includes
$10,000,000 for the continued pursuit of Federal copyright law
violations and software counterfeiting crimes. The U.S.
Attorneys shall report to the Committees on Appropriations by
April 30, 2003, on the number, type and location of copyright
prosecutions undertaken in the preceding year, including those
under Public Law 105-147.
The conferees also include bill language, similar to that
included in previous fiscal years, which: (1) makes up to
$2,500,000 for debt collection purposes available through
fiscal year 2004; (2) makes available up to $8,000 for official
reception and representation expenses; (3) makes up to
$10,000,000 for automated litigation support contracts
available until expended; (4) provides not to exceed $2,500,000
for the operation of the National Advocacy Center to remain
available until expended; and (5) specifies the number of
positions and workyears provided for the United States
Attorneys.
UNITED STATES TRUSTEE SYSTEM FUND
The conference agreement provides $155,736,000 for the
United States Trustees, to be funded entirely from offsetting
collections, instead of $159,161,000 as proposed by the House
and $150,381,000 as proposed by the Senate. The Conferees
understand that this account has $5,399,000 in prior year
unobligated balances previously appropriated to the Trustee.
The Conferees direct that these balances be used to offset this
account's fiscal year 2003 operational requirements.
The conference agreement includes $750,000 for the
Bankruptcy Training Center at the National Advocacy Center, in
support of the Trustees' continuing education program.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, FOREIGN CLAIMS SETTLEMENT COMMISSION
The conference agreement includes $1,136,000 for the
Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for fiscal year 2003.
The Commission settles claims of American citizens
arising out of nationalization, expropriation, or other takings
of their properties and interests by foreign governments.
United States Marshals Service
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $680,474,000 for this
account, instead of $684,174,000 as provided by the House and
$673,146,000 as provided by the Senate. The conference
agreement does not include the table included in the Statement
of Managers accompanying the Senate bill. However, the Marshals
are directed to submit a spend plan to the Committees on
Appropriations by March 30, 2003 for this account that is as
detailed as the Senate table. The conference agreement includes
$3,300,000 for Electronic Surveillance Unit [ESU] recurring
costs, $1,000,000 for hand/leg cuffs, and $10,015,000 for
special assignments.
Warrant Information Network. The conference agreement
includes not less than $2,766,000 (excluding a $500,000
transfer from the Justice Detainee Information System) for the
Warrant Information Network and subscriptions to various
networks and on-line systems. The Marshals, with assistance
from the Justice Department's Chief Information Officer, are
expected to implement the recommendations included the Justice
Department's Inspector General report (03-03) concerning the
Marshal Network and the Warrant Information Network.
Protection of the Judicial Process. The conference
agreement transfers $15,800,0000 for 106 senior Deputy U.S.
Marshals [DUSMs] from the ``Court Security'' account in title
III to this account. The conferees expect DUSMs and physical
security experts to regularly survey courthouses and make
security recommendations to the courts and the Committees on
Appropriations. In addition, the agreement provides $5,650,000
for 40 additional personnel and equipment, as requested, for
the protection of the Judiciary for high threat trials. In
addition, the agreement includes $2,259,000 for 18 positions to
be allocated to those districts with the highest priority
needs.
Courthouse security equipment. The conference agreement
includes $12,061,000 for security equipment, furnishings,
relocations, and telephone systems and cabling to improve
security at the most ill-equipped courthouses. The distribution
of these funds shall be described in the aforementioned spend
plan.
Fugitive apprehensions. The conference agreement includes
increases over the fiscal year 2003 request of $2,268,000 to
fully annualize the two existing fugitive task forces,
$2,916,000 to establish two additional centrally-managed
fugitive task forces in the heartland, and $2,750,000 for ESU
personnel, training, and equipment.
Other. The conference agreement also includes increases
over the fiscal year 2003 request of $1,715,000 to establish a
permanent Marshals Service presence in Jamaica, the Dominican
Republic, and Mexico and $10,424,000 for vehicles. The
conferees encourage the USMS to minimize the financial burden
of Federal court security on State and local jurisdictions to
the degree possible.
CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement includes $15,126,000 for this
account.
Construction engineering consultants.--The Committee is
aware that the Marshals have been using funds allocated by
Congress for consulting services on construction projects to
pay the federal salaries of nine permanent employees hired in
fiscal year 2000. Apparently, this diversion of funds was
prompted by confusion over terms and dollar amounts used by the
Marshals and Congress. The Conferees expect the salaries of
permanent employees to be paid out of the ``Salaries and
Expenses'' account. The Marshals are directed to report on the
proper execution of the construction engineering funds not
later than 30 days after enactment of this Act.
Billings, MT.--The funds provided for construction for
Billings shall only be available to renovate the Marshals
Service space, including designated prisoner movement and
holding areas, in the existing federal courthouse, space
previously occupied by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. No other
proposals are to be considered.
FEES AND EXPENSES OF WITNESSES
The conference agreement includes $175,645,000 for Fees
and Expenses of Witnesses for fiscal year 2003. This
appropriation, which is considered mandatory for scorekeeping
purposes, provides for fees and expenses of witnesses who
appear on behalf of the Government in cases in which the United
States is a party, including fact and expert witnesses, mental
competency examinations, and witness/informant protection.
Funds are also used to provide private counsel to pay certain
legal expenses of Federal employees. This year, the conferees
also include the costs associated with the U.S. Marshals
Service Witness Protection Program.
The conferees include new bill language regarding the
Witness Protection Program, and include language from previous
Appropriations acts which allows: (1) up to $6,000,000 for
protected witness safesites; (2) up to $1,000,000 for the
purchase and maintenance of armored vehicles for prisoner
transportation; and (3) up to $5,000,000 for installation and
operation of a secure automated network.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES, COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE
The conference agreement includes $9,474,000 for the
Community Relations Service for fiscal year 2003. The agreement
continues a provision that allows the Attorney General to
transfer up to $1,000,000 from funds made available to the
Department of Justice to this account, thereby providing for a
total funding level of up to $10,744,000.
The Community Relations Service was established by Title
X of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide assistance to
communities in resolving disagreements arising from
discriminatory practices.
The conference agreement includes bill language,
identical to that included in previous years, which allows the
Attorney General to provide additional resources for the
Community Relations Service, if emergent circumstances exist,
through the transfer of funds from other Department of Justice
programs, and subject to the requirements of section 605 of
this Act. The conference agreement also includes modified
language, as requested, clarifying the definition of the
activities of the Community Relations Service.
ASSETS FORFEITURE FUND
The conference agreement includes $21,901,000 for the
Assets Forfeiture Fund for fiscal year 2003.
This account provides funds for additional investigative
expenses of the FBI, DEA, and USMS, such as purchase of
evidence, equipping of conveyances, and investigative expenses
leading to seizure. Funds for these activities are provided
from receipts in the Assets Forfeiture Fund resulting from the
forfeiture of assets. Expenses related to the management and
disposal of assets are also provided from these receipts in the
Assets Forfeiture Fund by a permanent indefinite appropriation.
INTERAGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT
Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement
The conference agreement includes $372,131,000 for
Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement (ICDE) for fiscal year
2003. The ICDE program was created in 1982 to ensure a
coordinated, multi-agency approach to attacking and dismantling
high-level drug enterprises. Through its nine regional task
forces, the ICDE program utilizes the combined resources and
expertise of its 11 Federal agency members, in cooperation with
State and local investigators and prosecutors, to target and
destroy major narcotics trafficking and money laundering
organizations. Amounts provided reimburse Department of Justice
components for their costs to participate in ICDE task forces.
Additional funding for non-Justice Department agencies'
participation in ICDE is provided in other Appropriations acts.
It is expected that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
will continue to participate in this effort.
The table below reflects funding levels for each of the
components. The Justice Department is reminded that changes to
these levels are subject to section 605 of this Act.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The conferees have communicated concerns with regard to
the ability of Federal law enforcement to maintain a strong
focus on combating illegal drugs following the FBI's shift of
some 567 agents away from drug investigations. The Committees
on Appropriations approved the FBI's restructuring, and at the
same time requested a comprehensive plan to ensure that all of
the resources available to the Department of Justice to fight
illegal drugs are deployed in priority locations. The
Committees later approved a proposal by the DEA to shift 100 of
its agents and support staff in response to the withdrawal of
FBI agents. The Committee commends the DEA for taking this
action. However, the Committee has yet to receive a
comprehensive drug strategy from the Department, and urges
submission of this plan without further delay.
The conference agreement includes an increase of
$15,000,000 for the Drug Enforcement Administration for their
participation in task force operations. The conferees commend
the management of this program for emphasizing a strong focus
on disrupting and dismantling the major drug trafficking
organizations, and expect that this infusion of DEA agents and
support staff will further enhance these efforts. The conferees
also include an increase of $6,050,000 for needs associated
with OCDETF wiretap investigations generated by the DEA's
Special Operations Division, and an increase of $724,000 for
the U.S. Attorney's to establish an electronic surveillance
tactical group to assist U.S. Attorney's offices in conducting
electronic surveillance. To further the Justice Department's
ability to investigate the links between illegal drugs and
terrorism, an increase of $3,000,000 is provided for additional
financial investigative training and support.
The conferees include bill language, similar to that
included in previous Appropriations acts, which: (1) allows for
inter-governmental agreements with State and local law
enforcement agencies; (2) makes $50,000,000 available until
expended; (3) allows funds to be used under existing
authorities available to participating organizations; and (4)
allows the Attorney General to reallocate unobligated balances
among participating organizations, subject to the reprogramming
procedures described in Section 605 of this Act.
Federal Bureau of Investigation
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $4,234,587,000 for the
Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) salaries and expenses
account for fiscal year 2003. This level provides programmatic
increases totaling $491,281,000 to support the FBI's core
missions of counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and
cybercrime. The conferees also include increases to combat
violent crime and white collar crime, and for much needed
information technology enhancements. In addition to the amounts
provided to the FBI in this account, the conferees have
included bill language and additional funding to establish a
new account, the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF).
The following distribution represents the conference
agreement. The conferees remind the FBI that changes in this
distribution are subject to the reprogramming requirements in
section 605 of this Act.

Specific funding increases are provided as follows:
Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence.--The conference
agreement includes increases of $181,431,000 to bolster
counterterrorism and counterintelligence activities of the FBI.
Of this, an increase of $20,000,000 is provided for
intelligence analysts and associated equipment and support; and
an increase of $5,000,000 is to be transferred from the FBI to
the DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD) to ensure continued
collaboration on SOD activities. The FBI is expected to
reinvigorate its participation in this multi-agency task force
in order to strengthen the Justice Department's ability to
investigate links between the sale of illegal drugs and
terrorism. The conferees also include an additional $38,246,000
for NIPC, including $17,221,000 to fund phase II of a three-
phase research and development initiative being run by the
Special Technologies & Applications Unit. The conferees fully
expect the STAU to have occupied 4,000 square feet recently
made available at its new location in Virginia not later than
March 31, 2003. To ensure that these resources are completely
integrated with other information technology improvement
programs underway at the FBI, the FBI Chief Information Officer
is directed to review all ongoing information technology
products and activities of the cyber division, including the
National Infrastructure Protection Center, to ensure that
activities underway are commensurate with the mission of the
FBI, and that the products and techniques being developed are
shared with the FTTTF and other law enforcement agencies, as
appropriate. Finally, the conference agreement includes
$6,804,000 to expand the polygraph program.
Joint Terrorism Task Forces.--The conference agreement
includes an increase of $20,000,000 for the Joint Terrorism
Task Forces (JTTF) which have been successful in enhancing the
coordination of law enforcement at state, local and Federal
levels. The conferees, while supportive of the concept of the
JTTFs, want to ensure that these efforts complement and do not
duplicate other counterterrorism efforts underway at the
Department. Toward that end, the Bureau is directed to submit a
report to the Committees on Appropriations that includes a
thorough discussion of JTTF caseload over the last five years
by type (domestic/foreign), offense(s), and disposition
(referred for prosecution, prosecuted, convicted, etc.) on a
task force by task force basis. The report should also include
an explicit discussion of threats in existing or proposed JTTF
locations. The report shall be delivered not later than April
30, 2003.
Trilogy.--To date, the Committees on Appropriations have
provided the FBI with $457,800,000 for Trilogy, the FBI's three
year information technology upgrade plan. Funding of
$237,000,000, $132,000,000 more than requested, was provided in
Public Law 107-117 to complete the three-year funding stream in
two years and to hasten deployment. The conferees continue to
urge the FBI to deploy Trilogy as quickly as possible while
ensuring the integrity of the program. The fiscal year 2003
level includes an additional $8,000,000 as requested for
Trilogy contractor support. The Bureau shall continue to
provide quarterly status reports to the Committees on
Appropriations regarding Trilogy implementation. In addition,
the FBI CIO is directed to submit a plan to the Committee by
March 31, 2003 for reviewing all of the FBI's some 40 plus
databases, with the goal of removing applications that
haveoutlived their usefulness in order for the FBI to concentrate
resources on the highest priority information technology needs.
Information Technology Infrastructure.--In addition to
the increase provided for Trilogy, the conference agreement
provides increases of $126,776,000 to continue efforts to
provide the FBI with the most modern, efficient and effective
information technology tools to enable it to prevent terrorist
acts and further other critical priorities, including
counterintelligence and cybercrime. Within this amount, the
following increases are provided: $50,300,000 for investigative
data warehousing; $11,000,000 for collaborative capabilities;
$10,000,000 for digital storage and retrieval of documents from
counterterrorism investigations; $17,444,000 for mainframe
upgrades and continuity of operations at FBI headquarters; and
$3,032,000 for secure video teleconferencing. The agreement
also includes an increase of $5,000,000 for data mining. The
conferees are concerned that data mining efforts underway at
the FBI, the DEA and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force
are not being coordinated or exploited to the fullest extent
possible. Toward that end, the Justice Department is directed
to provide a report to the conferees by June 13, 2003 on
efforts to ensure that these efforts are complimentary, and not
duplicative, both from a technological standpoint, and a law
enforcement perspective. The conferees remain committed to
providing the FBI with adequate resources to ensure that its
information technology infrastructure enhances its ability to
prevent or investigate acts of terrorism and other crimes for
which it has responsibility. Toward that end, the conferees
have provided an additional $30,000,000 above the request for
emergent information technology needs. These funds are made
available to the FBI subject to the submission of spend plans
pursuant to section 605 requirements of this Act.
Information Technology Report.--The Committees on
Appropriations have provided the FBI with significant increases
for information technology. To ensure that this funding is
being centrally coordinated in order to provide the greatest
return on investment, the conferees expect the FBI to provide
an updated information technology report. This report shall
include a complete listing of all information technology
projects; the stage of each project's development and
deployment; base funding for each project, to include all
sources of funding; the fiscal year 2002 and 2003 funding level
of each project; and the outyear cost projections for each
project, including recurring requirements for operations and
maintenance of these systems. This report should also include a
plan for ensuring regular technology refreshment replacement
cycles, as well as estimated costs for these needs. This report
is to be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations by July
21, 2003.
Internet cafe.--The conference agreement includes
$3,620,000 for Internet cafe. A combination of a virtual
private network and the electronic equivalent of a mail drop,
Internet cafe will allow the FBI to establish a very low cost
secure network that parallels Trilogy and protects it from
penetration. The Bureau shall provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations on the distribution and use of
Internet cafe sites not later than May 1, 2003.
The conference agreement provides an additional
$12,612,000 above last year's level for tactical operations.
The amount provided should allow the FBI to keep pace with the
explosion of court-ordered surreptitious entries and the rapid
advance in easily obtained security technology and to cope with
the new threat of entry into facilities contaminated by
biological, chemical, radiological, or other hazardous
materials. The agreement also includes $18,435,000 as requested
for information assurance and $29,738,000 for the Enterprise
Security Operations Center to continue efforts to ensure that
sensitive data is more effectively managed. The Security
Division is directed to provide an update to the Committee by
April 30, 2003 regarding the FBI's internal security efforts.
This review should include an update on the use of the new
information technology enhancements provided during fiscal year
2002. The agreement also includes additional resources above
the request for intelligence production needs, as well as
surveillance and tactical operations.
The conference agreement also includes an increase of
$5,000,000 to ensure the highest integrity language translation
program, and to aggressively reduce the backlog of documents
that need to be translated. The FBI is directed to work with
the Foreign Service Institute regarding language-training needs
of the FBI. The conferees believe that the FBI needs to develop
more in-house expertise with regard to language translation
capabilities. The FBI is also directed to submit a report to
the Committees on Appropriations by June 2, 2003 regarding
efforts to implement section 323 of Public Law 107-306,
development of a civilian linguistic reserve corps.
Legal Attache Program.--The FBI received funding in
Public Law 107-206 to establish additional Legats, update the
Legat information infrastructure, and provide additional
resources to existing Legats that have realized appreciable
workload increases following the September 11th, 2001 terrorist
attacks. Accompanying report language directed that the FBI
submit a review of the Legat program prior to establishing
additional Legats. The Committees on Appropriations have yet to
receive this report. The FBI is directed to consult with the
Committees on Appropriations within 30 days following the
enactment of this Act to review the plan to deploy these
additional resources.
Quantico Training.--The ongoing FBI restructuring plan
revolves around a dramatic change in philosophy, shifting the
FBI's focus from investigating crimes to preventing acts of
terrorism. This change, coupled with the recruitment of new
agents, analysts and other support personnel, has created
significant new training requirements. The conferees therefore
provide $10,000,000 above the request for training needs,
including support for the newly created College of Analytic
Studies at Quantico, and for enhanced training in the fields of
cybercrime, counterintelligence and counterterrorism. This
additional funding shall also support the establishment of a
program to provide senior FBI agents and support staff with the
ability to earn advanced degrees in specialized areas that will
broaden and enhance their on-the-job effectiveness.
Support.--The conference agreement also provides
increases of $9,333,000 for the Hazardous Materials Response
Unit, $3,272,000 for the Hazardous Devices School, and
$7,919,000 for Evidence Response Teams.
DNA matching.--The conference agreement includes an
increase of $867,000 for the Federal Convicted Offender
Program, which maintains a DNA database of Federal convicts for
cross-referencing with crime scene evidence. The conference
agreement also includes an increase of $4,000,000 to maintain
or establish four regional mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) forensic
labs in affiliation with the FBI Laboratory. The labs will
analyze mtDNA from human remains or other evidence to assist
law enforcement in the identification of missing persons or
criminal perpetrators. Affiliation with the FBI Laboratory
ensures that uniform standards and procedures are maintained by
all of the participating laboratories doing mtDNA analysis. The
conferees note that the four scientists and technicians
required to oversee regional labs were funded last year, but
the labs themselves were not.
Serial rapists.--The conference agreement includes an
increase of $1,005,000 to expand the Violent Criminal
Apprehension Program to include sexual assault cases, which
should greatly improve the ability of law enforcement at all
levels to identify, capture, and prosecute serial rapists.
Forensic research.--The conference agreement includes an
increase of $8,056,000 over last year to fund the highest
priority forensic research proposals submitted to Congress by
the FBI Laboratory as part of its fiscal year 2002 spend plan.
The FBI shall report back to the Committees on Appropriations
on the disposition of these resources not later than May 1,
2003.
Engineering Research Facility.--Last year, Congress
funded the construction of a new annex at the Engineering
Research Facility (ERF). Since then, the conferees have become
aware that a flaw in the FBI's cost analysis, the failure to
include cabling, wiring, and equipment costs, and out-dated
pricing data, which failed to capture inflation through the
life of the construction project, resulted in an under-estimate
of the true cost of the annex. Considering the importance of
this facility, the conference agreement includes $7,945,000 to
partially cover the full costs of the ERF annex. The conferees
urge the Bureau to complete this project as quickly as is
prudent.
Aviation Support Program.--The conference agreement
includes an increase of $18,953,000, including $13,000,000 for
additional aircraft and related equipment. The conferees
understand that the FBI is developing a proposal for needs
associated with locations in the Northeast, and direct the FBI
to submit this proposal in conjunction with a five year
aviation master plan that includes: (1) current fleet assets by
type, (2) logged flight hours by mission by aircraft/
helicopter, (3) projected useful service life remaining by
aircraft/helicopter, (4) utilization of current fleet assets,
by mission type, for the last five years by year, and (5)
basing, by aircraft/helicopter locations. The plan should also
discuss the costs and benefits of maintaining versus replacing
current fleet assets through 2008, maldeployments or other
causes of underutilization of current fleet assets, if
applicable, and capabilities of current fleet assets versus
current and projected mission requirements. The report shall be
delivered not later than May 1, 2003.
Violent Crime.--The conferees also include an increase of
$5,000,000 for the FBI's continued involvement in the National
Integrated Ballistics Information Network, or NIBIN. Funding
will support research, development and equipment for these
activities. The conference agreement also includes an increase
of $10,000,000 for efforts to combat violent crime. The
conferees expect the FBI to bring a national focus to cases
that cross jurisdictions, including the activities of criminal
alien gangs across the United States.
White Collar Crime.--The conferees include an increase of
$10,000,000 to provide key investigative assets to fight
corporate fraud. This increase, along with increases provided
elsewhere in this bill for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. Attorneys, will strengthen the Federal
government's capabilities to bring corporate fraudsters to
justice, and to protect investors, employees and consumers.
Trafficking.--The conferees support the FBI's continued
involvement in the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative,
and provide an increase of $3,000,000 above the request for
these purposes. As noted elsewhere in this report, the Justice
Department is directed to submit a report to the Committees on
Appropriations regarding efforts to combat sexual trafficking.
Advisory Board.--The conference agreement includes a
$5,000,000 increase and accompanying bill language to establish
an Advisory Board. The Advisory Board will be a standing panel
of outside experts to advise the FBI Director on matters
relating to science, technology, research, engineering,
information management, and other matters of special interest
to the FBI. The Committees on Appropriations believe that the
organizational changes and management reforms being pursued by
the current FBI Director would be enhanced by the establishment
of a panel of experts who can independently and regularly
advise the Director on how the FBI can more effectively exploit
and apply science and technology to improve its operations,
particularly with respect to information sharing, data mining
and the analysis of information and evidence collected during
investigations. The efforts of the panel should be focused on
the pressing and complex technology challenges facing the FBI,
particularly the priorities of preventing terrorist attacks,
countering foreign intelligence operations, combating cyber-
based attacks, and strengthening the FBI's collaboration with
other Federal law enforcement agencies and within the
Intelligence Community. The panel will focus exclusively on
strategic issues, and on suggesting and assessing
organizational strategies for applying technology. Not later
than 60 days after enactment of this legislation, the Director
shall report to the Committees on Appropriations regarding
progress toward establishing this panel.
The conferees include bill language, similar to that
included in previous Appropriations acts, which provides: (1)
for purchase of not to exceed 1,576 passenger vehicles, of
which 1,085 will be for replacement only, without regard to
general purchase price limitations, and the acquisition and
operation of aircraft; (2) up to $70,000 for unforeseen
emergencies; (3) up to $65,000,000 for automated data
processing, telecommunications and technical equipment, and up
to $1,000,000 for undercover operations to remain available
until September 30, 2004; (4) not less than $475,300,000 for
counterterrorism investigations, foreign counterintelligence,
and national security activities; (5) up to $10,000,000 to
reimburse State and local police for assistance related to
violent crime, terrorism and drug investigations; (6) up to
$50,000 for official reception and representation expenses; and
(7) specifies the number of positions and workyears provided
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, bill
language is included, as carried in prior fiscal years, setting
forth certain authorities.
Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force
The conference agreement establishes a separate account
for the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF), and
includes funding of $62,000,000, the full amount requested, for
additional data collection and data sharing initiatives. The
conferees direct the Attorney General to ensure that the
efforts of the FTTTF are coordinated with, and not duplicative
of, other information technology enhancement initiatives taking
place throughout the Department.
The conferees are concerned that there remain
disagreements within the Administration on the evidence needed
to deny a visa on terrorism grounds. The conferees expect the
Administration to develop a comprehensive set of standards by
which to review visa applications, and to provide training for
consular officers to use in reviewing visa applications. More
guidance about this issue is also provided under Title IV of
this Act. The conferees strongly support the recommendations
contained in GAO's report, Border Security: Visa Process Should
Be Strengthened as an Antiterrorism Tool, and recommend that
the Administration implement its recommendations for
strengthening the visa application process.
CONSTRUCTION
The conferees include $1,250,000 for FBI construction.
Drug Enforcement Administration
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes total budget authority
of $1,649,948,000 for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
salaries and expenses account for fiscal year 2003, of which
$89,029,000 is derived from the Diversion Control Fund,
resulting in a direct appropriation of $1,560,919,000.
The following distribution represents the conference
agreement. The DEA is reminded that any changes to this
distribution are subject to the reprogramming requirements in
section 605 of this Act.

Additional Drug Enforcement Agents.--As noted elsewhere
in the conference agreement, the FBI's restructuring plan
shifted 567 agents away from drug investigations to focus on
fighting terrorism. Therefore, to compensate for this
reduction, the conference agreement includes $15,000,000 above
the request to hire an additional 133 agents and support staff.
As noted earlier in this agreement, the conferees note that the
Justice Department has yet to submit the plan requested by the
Committees on Appropriations regarding the strategy to maintain
a strong focus on fighting illegal drug activity. The Justice
Department is directed to submit this strategy as expeditiously
as possible. The agreement also includes $7,750,000 in
available prior year recoveries for vehicles, bullet proof
vests, and other basic equipment essential to agents in the
performance of their duties.
Overseas Offices.--The DEA is directed to submit a report
to the Committees on Appropriations by May 23, 2003 which
provides a workload analysis and right sizing proposal as
warranted for each overseas offices to ensure that the most
urgent needs are being met with the limited resources
available.
Financial Investigations.--The conference agreement
includes an increase of $4,121,000, 27 positions and 14
workyears, to strengthen the DEA's ability to better monitor
and track the financial holdings and transactions of drug
trafficking organizations, especially with regard to
investigating the links between the sale of illegal drugs and
terrorist organizations. Toward that end, the conference
agreement directs the DEA to use $25,000,000 in prior year
recoveries for activities of the Special Operations Division.
The FBI and the DEA shall brief the Committees on
Appropriations on a quarterly basis beginning July 7, 2003
regarding efforts in this area.
Information Infrastructure.--The conference agreement
recommends an additional $6,683,000, 23 positions and 11 FTE to
further strengthen DEA's data security infrastructure. The DEA
should ensure that these enhancements are consistent with the
Department's overall information technology security programs.
Physical Security Measures.--The conference agreement
includes a requested increase of $18,000,000 for additional
anti-terrorism security measures at both domestic and foreign
locations. As noted earlier in this report, the conferees
expect the Justice Department to submit a comprehensive plan to
ensure the safety of employees at all installations.
The conferees expect DEA to continue to provide quarterly
reports on the investigative workhours and funding, by type,
within major source and transit countries, including the
Caribbean, delineated by country and function. The DEA shall
report to the Committees on Appropriations, by June 1, 2003,
providing a trend analysis gleaned from information provided in
these reports.
OxyContin.--The Committee on Appropriations continue to
be concerned with the availability of legal drugs that are
diverted for illegal use, and in particular the prescription
drug OxyContin, especially in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky. This epidemic is gaining a foothold in other areas of
the country. To continue progress toward establishing a
nationwide prescription drug monitoring program, the conferees
include $10,000,000 under the Office of Justice Programs (OJP)
to continue implementation of the Harold Rogers Prescription
Drug Monitoring Program. The conferees expect the DEA to
continue to work with OJP on the implementation of this
program, and to continue to provide the Committees on
Appropriations with regular updates regarding efforts to thwart
the illegal diversion of OxyContin and other legal drugs.
Methamphetamines.--The conferees remain concerned with
the continuing problem of Ecstasy and methamphetamine use
across the United States. The conferees expect the DEA to
continue working with OJP and COPS on the implementation of its
COPS methamphetamine programs, and to continue participating in
the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, particularly those
operating in the Midwest, to combat the influx of
methamphetamines.
Aviation Support Program.--The conferees direct the DEA
to submit a five year aviation master plan that includes: (1)
current fleet assets by type, (2) logged flight hours by
mission by aircraft/helicopter, (3) projected useful service
life remaining by aircraft/helicopter, (4) utilization of
current fleet assets, by mission type, for the last five years
by year, and (5) basing, by aircraft/helicopter locations. The
plan should also discuss the costs and benefits of maintaining
versus replacing current fleet assets through 2008,
maldeployments or other causes of underutilization of current
fleet assets, if applicable, and capabilities of current fleet
assets versus current and projected mission requirements. The
report shall be delivered not later than May 1, 2003.
Drug Diversion Control Fee Account.--The recommendation
includes $89,029,000 for DEA's Drug Diversion Control Program
for fiscal year 2003. The conference agreement assumes that the
level of balances in the Fee Account are sufficient to fully
support diversion control programs in fiscal year 2003. As was
the case in previous fiscal years, no funds are provided in the
DEA salaries and expenses appropriation for this account in
fiscal year 2003.
To control the diversion, distribution, manufacture and
abuse of legitimate pharmaceuticals, DEA annually registers in
excess of 900,000 drug handlers, of which over 1,670 are
manufacturers, distributors, importers, exporters, and others
handling large volumes of controlled substances. These
registrants pay fees, which fully support the cost of this
program. The conferees are aware that the DEA is proposing to
change its fee structure, and urge the DEA to consult with the
Committees on Appropriations regarding these changes.
The conference agreement includes bill language which
provides: (1) up to $70,000 for unforeseen emergencies; (2) for
expenses for drug education and training programs; (3) for
purchase of passenger vehicles without regard to general
purchase price limitations, and acquisition and operation of
aircraft; (4) up to $33,000 for permanent change of status
costs; (5) up to $1,800,000 for research to remain available
until expended; (6) up to $4,000,000 for evidence and
information, up to $10,000,000 for automated data processing
and telecommunications, up to $2,000,000 for laboratory
equipment, $4,000,000 for technical equipment, and $2,000,000
for aircraft replacement parts to remain available until
September 30, 2004; and (7) up to $50,000 for official
reception and representation expenses. In addition, language is
continued which specifies the number of positions and workyears
provided to DEA.
CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement includes $7,250,000 in available
prior year recoveries for construction of a new laboratory
facility in Miami, Florida.
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE
The conference agreement includes total new spending
authority of $6,159,529,000 for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) for fiscal year 2003. This amount
includes $3,848,456,000 in direct appropriations and
$2,311,073,000 in anticipated fee collections. The conference
agreement includes funding for border enforcement and
immigration services under the Salaries and Expenses account,
but does not adopt the Administration's request to establish a
Support and Administration account. The conferees are aware
that the INS will soon transfer from the Justice Department to
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Guidance provided
below is assumed to apply to any successor organizations of the
INS that may be created within the DHS.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Funding provided for the INS Salaries and Expenses
account includes a total direct appropriation of $3,589,819,000
for salaries and expenses, including $2,880,819,000 for
Immigration Enforcement and Border Affairs, and $709,000,000
for Immigration Services.
Immigration Enforcement and Border Affairs
The conference agreement includes $2,880,819,000 for
Immigration Enforcement and Border Affairs. This account
provides for activities related to border inspections, border
patrol, investigations, detention and deportation, and
intelligence.
Entry Exit.--The conference agreement includes an
increase of $362,000,000, for the Entry Exit program and
related information technology infrastructure upgrades. This
funding is available for obligation pending submission of a
comprehensive plan from the Secretary of Homeland Security for
the Entry Exit program and needed information technology
upgrades. The Committees on Appropriations held a series of
briefings throughout the fiscal year regarding the planning and
progress of the Entry Exit program, but have been disappointed
by the lack of senior management involvement and oversight of
this program, and by the lack of detail about how funds will be
used. The conferees note that the Administration provided a
plan for expenditure of funds in January 2003, which largely
included funding for construction, and did not provide any
detail on the technological solutions that would be employed to
implement this program, nor any discussion regarding the
involvement of Mexico and Canada and how any infrastructure
changes between the U.S. and these countries would be
accomplished. The conferees expect the INS to follow the
direction contained in the report accompanying Public Law 107-
206 regarding the involvement of the General Accounting Office
(GAO) in the development and review of the Entry Exit program.
The GAO should review and make recommendations to the INS prior
to submission of plans to the Committees on Appropriations. The
INS shall report to the Committees on Appropriations on a
quarterly basis, beginning April 1, 2003, regarding Entry Exit
program development. The conferees expect the INS to ensure
full and open competition with regard to procurement actions,
and to ensure that any funding proposals for subsequent years
include a full analysis of expected operations and maintenance
costs. As part of this plan, the conferees encourage the INS to
explore biometric alternatives for use in developing more
tamper resistant passports and INS re-entry documents. The
conferees also direct the DHS to submit a report not later than
July 1, 2003, to the Committees on Appropriations identifying
the number of green cards currently used with no expiration
date or security features, the original date the cards were
issued, as well as a proposed plan to replace these older green
cards, if necessary.
Passenger and Crew Manifests.--One of the primary goals
of the Entry Exit Program is to improve the collection,
analysis and dissemination of information on passengers and
crews at ports-of-entry, including the verification of traveler
identity and access to data relevant to the determination of
the excludability of the traveler. Such information is critical
to the development of threat assessments. The INS' current
paper-based system and stove-piped databases limit its ability
to produce and coordinate such information with other agencies
responsible for collecting this and similar critical
information. The Congress enacted Public Law 107-295 directing
the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop and
establish a Maritime Intelligence System (MIS), as defined in
section 70113 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of
2002 to address this very problem. The MIS system is intended
to integrate and analyze collected data on passenger and crew
manifests and any other relevant information that could be
construed as potential threats against the United States. In
order for this system to work, INS and other agencies that
collect data on passengers and crew manifests must cooperate
fully. Therefore, the conference agreement directs the INS to
transfer $25,000,000 to the TSA as a reimbursement for its MIS
activities and requirements. The conferees expect MIS to
include the data collected through the Container Security
Initiative (CSI) program and other passenger, crew and cargo
information collection systems. The conferees understand that
the CSI program will enable the collection of additional
shipping data through enhanced cooperative relationships
between the U.S. Customs Service and foreign customs services.
Border Patrol Agents.--The conference agreement includes
an increase of $57,207,000, 570 positions and 285 FTE for new
Border Patrol Agents, bringing the number of Border Patrol
Agents to 11,000. The conferees expect the INS to submit a
deployment plan to the Committees on Appropriations for the new
agents provided, and to ensure that this plan is coordinated
with construction projects and ongoing Entry Exit program
planning. The INS should continue to provide the Committees on
Appropriations with quarterly status reports on border patrol
hiring, with the first such report due no later than April 1,
2003.
Immigration Inspectors.--The conference agreement
includes an increase of $25,500,000 to hire an additional 460
land border ports of entry inspectors. These inspectors shall
be deployed along both the Northern and Southern borders. The
conferees are concerned with staffing levels at the Ambassador
Bridge/Detroit Tunnel, the Santa Teresa and Columbus ports of
entry in New Mexico, and urge the INS to ensure that staffing
levels are sufficient at these important ports of entry.
Pay Upgrades.--In response to concerns raised regarding a
high rate of attrition of Border Patrol Agents and Immigration
Inspectors, the Committees on Appropriations provided emergency
supplemental funding in Public Law 107-206 for pay upgrades.
The conference agreement continues this direction by including
an increase of $58,550,000 for pay upgrades for Border Patrol
Agents and Immigration Inspectors. The conferees note that this
was not in the Administration's request. The conferees direct
the Administration to submit a legislative proposal to the
Congress with the FY 2004 budget that establishes a
comprehensive, equitable program to compensate Federal law
enforcement.
Interior Enforcement.--The conferees include an increase
of $10,000,000 for interior enforcement needs. This increase
will provide the INS with additional staff to investigate and
deport the more than 300,000 alien fugitives who have been
ordered removed or deported from the U.S. but have failed to
comply with those orders. The conferees are aware of a growing
number of illegal aliens in Bettendorf and Davenport, Iowa;
Moline and Rock Island, Illinois; and the Roanoke area in the
upper Shenandoah Valley, and direct the INS to review staffing
levels in these areas.
Joint Terrorism Task Forces.-The conference agreement
continues to support the concept of Joint Terrorism Task Forces
(JTTFs), and therefore includes an increase of $6,000,000, 59
positions and 30 FTE for INS participation in JTTFs. This
funding complements funding provided to the FBI and other
Department of Justice components for these multi-agency law
enforcement activities.
Interior Checkpoints.--Bill language is retained
prohibiting funds for the site acquisition, design, or
construction of any permanent Border Patrol checkpoint in the
Tucson sector. The INS is reminded that it must not operate a
checkpoint at the same location for seven consecutive days
during a 14-day period in the Tucson Sector. The conferees
direct INS to submit a report to the Committees on
Appropriations by June 27, 2003, regarding the checkpoint
program. This report should include a list of all checkpoints,
when they were established, a profile of all resources
associated with each checkpoint, as well as current and
historical statistics. This review should discuss the
checkpoint program, and how it complements the overall border
security enforcement strategy in recognition of urgent homeland
security issues. The conferees direct the Tucson Sector to
continue negotiations regarding the relocation of Tucson Sector
helicopter operations to Sierra Vista, Arizona.
Border Patrol Equipment.--Of the amounts provided for
Border Patrol equipment, the Border Patrol is directed to
provide no less than $5,000,000 to procure lightweight handheld
thermal imagers for Border Patrol field use and operations. The
conferees support the continuation of ISIS and RVIS, and direct
the INS to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations
by July 7, 2003, regarding the status of these initiatives,
particularly in light of the deployment issues that have arisen
on the Northern Border because of the differences in climate
and terrain. The conference agreement also includes $40,000,000
for vehicles. The conferees note that base funding is provided
for every on board agent, and funding for each new agent hired
includes funds to purchase new vehicles. The conferees urge the
INS to ensure that funds provided for vehicles and other basic
agent needs are spent as provided by the Congress, and not
diverted for other uses.
Injured Illegal Aliens.--The conferees believe hospitals
in Cochise, Pima, Santa Cruz and Yuma Counties, Arizona are
bearing an unfair burden as a result of illegal immigrants
injured as a result of interaction with the Border Patrol, and
therefore direct the INS to provide such sums as necessary to
reimburse hospitals in these counties, as authorized by
sections 562 and 563 of the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996, as amended. The conferees believe
that this one-time funding infusion is appropriate until a
nation-wide solution is developed in fiscal year 2003. This
funding is only available to the extent that these costs are
not otherwise reimbursed through other Federal programs or
cannot be recovered from the alien or another person. The
conferees direct the INS, in coordination with the Department
of Health and Human Services, to provide a report by July 1,
2003 to the Committees on Appropriations with recommendations
to address this issue.
Trafficking.--To continue efforts to combat the illegal
trafficking into this country of some 50,000 women and children
every year, the conference agreement includes an increase of
$3,662,000 for costs associated with effectively implementing
provisions of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence
Protection Act. The conferees continue to be supportive of the
INS' Violence Against Women Act Processing Unit which is
responsible for the adjudication of immigration cases filed by
victims of violence including battered immigrants, trafficking
victims and other immigrant victims of crime. The conferees
encourage the Administration to ensure that sufficient funding
is available for the Unit to continue to adjudicate and process
immigration cases.
Alternatives to Detention.--The conference agreement
includes $3,000,000 for alternatives to detention to promote
community-based programs for supervised release from detention
such as the Vera Institute for Justice's Appearance Assistance
Project or other similar programs. These funds shall not be
available for new or existing detention facilities, including
non-secure detention and/or shelter care detention facilities.
Legal Orientation.--The conference agreement also
includes $1,000,000 for non-governmental agencies to provide
``live presentations'' to persons in INS detention prior to
their first hearing before an immigration judge. These
presentations will provide immigration detainees with essential
information about immigration court procedures and the
availability of legal remedies to assist detainees in
distinguishing between meritorious cases and frivolous cases.
Criminal Aliens.--The conferees understand that the INS
has an ongoing program to identify and deport criminal aliens
in local and county jails, pursuant to Public Law 105-141,
which requires the Attorney General to establish a program in
local prisons to identify, prior to arraignment, criminal
aliens and aliens who are unlawfully present in the United
States. The conferees expect that within existing resources
provided for detention and removal of aliens, the INS will
continue to support this program, and increase resources as
warranted for these activities. A recent Inspector General
audit noted a number of problems in the INS' Institutional
Removal Program, including the fact that INS has failed to
identify all deportable criminal aliens, including aggravated
felons. The conferees support the recommendations provided in
the audit, and urge the INS to adopt them as expeditiously as
possible. Similarly, the conferees have provided funding for
the High Intensity Criminal Alien Apprehension and Prosecution
program to use automated fingerprint technology to improve the
identification, apprehension, and prosecution of previously
deported criminal aliens in L.A. County. The conferees direct
INS to allocate sufficient staff, if warranted, to the Los
Angeles office, in order to enter the fingerprint records of
all deportable criminal aliens incarcerated in prisons and
jails into the CAL-ID database in a timely fashion.
Immigration Services
The conference agreement includes $709,000,000 for
Immigration Services.
Eliminating the Backlog of Immigration Applications.--The
June 2002 Backlog Elimination Plan states that the INS will
reach a national average processing time of six months or less
for all applications by the end of fiscal year 2003, and will
achieve a processing time standard of six months or less at
every office by the end of fiscal year 2004. From 1993 to 2000,
more than 6,900,000 legal immigrants have applied for
citizenship, more than in the previous 40 years combined. The
Committees on Appropriations have provided more than
$430,000,000 in appropriations to the INS over the last six
years to address the backlog of applications and to improve the
integrity of the naturalization process; this funding is in
addition to the more than $4,500,000,000 in fees that the INS
has collected to process applications. The INS estimates that
it will process about 9,400,000 applications in fiscal year
2003. The conferees look forward to receiving quarterly updates
from the INS regarding efforts to achieve these new standards.
The conferees expect that if the INS realigns existing staff to
better address workload issues, that any shift in employees
will be subject to reprogramming requirements in this Act.
The conferees continue to hear from Members of Congress
and their constituents with concerns about the lack of
attentiveness to requests for better service with regard to the
processing of immigration applications. The conferees receive
many requests for additional resources in the nearest INS
office or for the opening of new INS offices to deal with
backlogs. The conferees again urge the INS to review staffing
levels throughout the country to ensure that resources are
deployed to match work requirements. The conferees expect the
INS to direct special emphasis toward backlog reduction
problems in Northern Virginia; New York, New York; the Bronx,
New York; the state of Iowa; Northern New Jersey; Florida;
Arizona; and Michigan. The conferees also urge the INS to make
every effort to acquire space in Portland, Oregon's Central
Business District for its District Office.
Inadmissable Aliens.--The conferees direct the INS to
remain vigilant with regard to enforcing section 212 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended. This
section pertains to the general classes of aliens ineligible to
receive visas. The conferees are particularly concerned with
people who are granted entrance into the United States who may
have been foreign intelligence operatives against the United
States; who have been or are involved in trafficking in
persons; or who are foreign government officials who have
engaged in particularly severe violations of human rights or
religious freedom. The INS, in cooperation with the State
Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, is directed to submit
a report no later than June 27, 2003, describing efforts to
enforce the provisions of Section 212. The conferees continue
to urge the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to deny
immigrant or non-immigrant visas to any citizens of the
People's Republic of China whom they determine participates in
or otherwise supports organ harvesting.
OFFSETTING FEE COLLECTIONS
The conference agreement assumes a total of
$2,311,073,000 in offsetting fee collections paid by persons
who are traveling internationally or who are applying for
immigration benefits. These fees support activities related to
the legal admission of persons into the United States. The
conferees are concerned about the findings of a recent
Inspector General audit which found that INS fee collection
procedures are poor and subject to errors and theft. Therefore,
the INS is directed to adopt and enforce more stringent
accounting procedures regarding the collection of fees for
these activities as noted in this recent report.
Immigration Inspections User Fees.--The conference
agreement assumes $658,295,000 of spending from offsetting
collections in this account. Last year, the conferees supported
an increase in the INS user fee account to provide for
additional inspectors and to facilitate the use of technology
to improve the ability to process international air travelers
and provide for greater security measures. Despite these
increases, the Congress continues to hear concerns about
staffing levels at airports around the country. Therefore, the
conferees expect the INS to hire up to an additional 615
airport immigration inspectors and support staff with the
expected increase in fee revenues. The conferees are
particularly concerned with staffing levels at the Detroit
International Airport and the Miami International Airport, and
urge the INS to review staffing at all airports to ensure
appropriate coverage to facilitate travel while ensuring secure
borders. These new inspectors are expected to be deployed at
new and renovated terminals, as well as at high growth
airports. The conferees also direct the INS to hire up to an
additional 85 seaport immigration inspectors and 8 support
staff. The conferees include language clarifying that the newly
established immigration inspection fee is intended to be
applied to cruise ship passengers, and not to individuals who
use ferries on a daily basis. The INS should consult with the
Committees on Appropriations prior to the deployment of these
new positions.
Immigration Examinations Fees.--The conference agreement
assumes $1,443,803,000 to support the adjudication of
applications for immigration benefits, to be derived from fees
collected from persons applying for immigration benefits. This
funding level assumes an increase of $50,496,000 to continue
efforts to reduce the backlog of applications and at the same
time improve the integrity of the process. As noted previously,
the INS is expected to provide quarterly updates to the
Congress regarding implementation of its Five Year Backlog
Reduction Plan. The INS is expected to provide no less than
$43,000,000 for the telephone customer service center and no
less than $7,200,000 for the indexing and conversion of INS
microfilm images. The conferees support the ongoing efforts of
the INS to index and convert deteriorating records to digital
format, which ensures that the records will be maintained, and
more readily searchable.
Land Border Inspections Fees.--The conference agreement
assumes $21,700,000 in spending from the Land Border Inspection
Fund. The revenues generated in this account are from Dedicated
Commuter Lanes in Blaine and Port Roberts, Washington; Detroit
Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge, Michigan; and Otay Mesa,
California; and Automated Permit Ports which provide pre-
screened local border residents border crossing privileges by
means of automated inspections. The conferees fully support the
concept of Dedicated Commuter Lanes, and expect the INS to
employ the lessons learned in this program to the development
of the Entry Exit program.
Breached Bond/Detention Fund.--The conference agreement
assumes $171,275,000 in spending for detention of illegal
aliens from the Immigration Breached Bond/Detention Fund in
fiscal year 2003. The allowance assumes that $50,069,000 will
be used to fund additional detention space needs. The conferees
expect the INS to rely on a mix of INS, private and state
facilities for these additional needs. Resources available in
this Fund are derived from the recovery of breached cash
andsurety bonds in excess of $8,000,000, which are deposited in the
Fund as offsetting collections. In addition, resources are also
available in this account from a portion of fees charged under section
245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The conferees are aware
that the number of detainee complaints and disturbances has decreased
at the San Pedro Service Processing Center as a result of counseling
and religious services being offered to detainees. The INS is directed
to provide no less than $1,500,000 to continue to provide such services
to detainees at the INS Service Processing Centers.
H-1B Fees.--The conference agreement includes $10,000,000
to process H-1B visas.
The H-1B is a temporary visa category for non-immigrant,
highly skilled workers.
The conference agreement includes bill language, similar
to that included in previous Appropriations acts, which
provides: (1) up to $50,000 to meet unforeseen emergencies of a
confidential nature; (2) for the purchase of motor vehicles for
police-type use and for uniforms, without regard to general
purchase price limitations; (3) for the acquisition and
operation of aircraft; (4) up to $400,000 for research to be
available until expended; (5) up to $5,000,000 for payments to
State and local law enforcement agencies engaged in cooperative
activities related to immigration; (6) up to $5,000,000 to fund
or reimburse other Federal agencies for costs associated with
the repatriation of smuggled aliens; (7) up to $5,000 for
official reception and representation expenses; (8) a limit on
the level of funding for the Office of Legislative and Public
Affairs; (9) a limit on the amount of funding available for
non-career positions; (10) separate headings for Immigration
Enforcement and Border Affairs and Immigration Services; (11)
revised language carried in previous Appropriations acts
regarding the operation of the checkpoints in the Tucson
Sector; and (12) deletes language carried in previous
Appropriations acts regarding the operation of the San Clemente
and Temecula checkpoints.
CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement includes $258,637,000 for
construction projects for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service for fiscal year 2003. The conference agreement does not
adopt the proposal of the Administration to provide funding for
construction under the salaries and expenses account but
instead continues funding for these activities under a separate
account.
This funding directly supports the Congress' commitment
to ensuring that adequate facilities are provided for the
increasing number of Border Patrol Agents and Immigration
Inspectors being deployed to ensure safe borders. Of the
amounts provided, not less than $3,000,000 shall be used on
border fences and other barrier construction in the Douglas,
Naco and Nogales corridors, and such sums as necessary to
continue fencing efforts in the San Diego corridor. The
conferees direct that not less than $1,000,000 be used for the
Tucson Sector Air Operations facility in Sierra Vista, which
the Committees on Appropriations directed be implemented last
year.
The conference agreement provides the following

Federal Prison System
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes a fiscal year 2003
appropriation of $4,071,251,000 for the salaries and expenses
of the Federal Prison System. The conferees recognize the
critical importance of providing adequate space for the
incarceration of sentenced and unsentenced Federal prisoners,
and the need to activate newly constructed prison facilities.
Activation and Expansion of New Prisons.--The conference
agreement includes an increase of $101,416,000 for the
activation of the new medium security facility in Glenville,
West Virginia; and the new high security facilities at Big
Sandy, Kentucky; McCreary, Kentucky; and Victorville,
California. This amount will provide for more than 4,400 new
beds. The conferees also include increases of $10,132,000 for
expansion at the Marion, Illinois facility and at the Safford,
Arizona facility. This amount will provide for more than 764
new beds.
The conferees include new bill language designating
funding levels provided for the activities under this account.
Bill language, similar to that included in previous
Appropriations acts, is also included which provides: (1) for
the purchase of motor vehicles for police-type use; (2) for the
provision of technical advice to foreign governments; (3) for
transfer of funds to the Health Resources and Services
Administration; (4) for the Director to enter into contracts to
furnish health care; (5) up to $6,000 for reception and
representation expenses; (6) up to $20,000,000 for contract
confinement expenses for the care and security of Cuban and
Haitian entrants; and (7) for the Federal Prison System to
enter into contracts and other agreements with private entities
for multi-year periods for the confinement of Federal
prisoners. The conference agreement also includes a requested
change in the number of new and replacement automobile
purchases, and includes language, as requested, designating an
amount to remain available for two fiscal years.
Buildings and Facilities
The conference agreement includes $399,227,000 for fiscal
year 2003 for the construction, modernization, maintenance and
repair of prison and detention facilities housing Federal
prisoners. The conferees agree that none of the funds
appropriated for the Federal Prison System in this or prior
Appropriations acts for the construction of new prison
facilities shall be rescinded or cancelled. Further, the
conferees expect all current projects to move forward as
planned. The conferees provide increases of $225,972,000 for
facilities with prior funding:

National Institute of Justice (NIJ).--The conference
agreement provides $59,879,000 for the National Institute of
Justice.
Office of Science and Technology.--The conferees commend
the efforts of the leadership of the National Institute of
Justice's (NIJ) Office of Science and Technology (OS&T). This
office has assisted local law enforcement in making significant
advances in the areas of non-intrusive, concealed weapons and
contraband detection, vehicle stopping, DNA testing, public
safety standards development, officer protection, less-than-
lethal incapacitation, public safety communications,
information management, counterterrorism, crime mapping,
location and tracking, secure communications, and noninvasive
drug detection. In addition, the conferees commend and
encourage the continuing partnership that OS&T has developed
with the National Institute of Standards and Technology with
the goal of developing standards and carrying out scientific
and engineering research related to the public safety
community.
To implement the mission of OS&T, pursuant to The
Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), the
conference agreement includes $33,000,000 for OS&T from within
the overall amount provided for NIJ. In addition, within the
funds provided for the local law enforcement block grant
program, $20,000,000 is for OS&T to assist local law
enforcement units in identifying, selecting, developing,
modernizing, and purchasing new technologies in accordance with
the aforementioned Act.
The National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology
Centers.--Since 1994, the National Law Enforcement and
Corrections Technology Centers (NLECTC) have served the State
and local law enforcement and corrections communities by
providing support, research findings, and technical expertise
on issues that allow them to perform their jobs safer and more
effectively. The NLECTC system consists of facilities located
across the country and each facility specializes in one or more
specific areas of research and development. The conferees
commend the work that NIJ's Office of Science and Technology
[OS&T], and through it the NLECTC system, has done to improve
the capabilities of the law enforcement and corrections
communities. To further the work of the NLECTC system, the
conferees recommend $17,000,000 for the continued support of
the system. These funds are to be distributed equally among the
Northeast Regional Center, Southeast Regional Center, Rocky
Mountain Regional Center, Western Regional Center, Rural Law
Enforcement Technology Center, and Northwest Center. The
conferees continue to support the Centers receiving
reimbursable funding from other accounts as needed.
Within available funds, the conferees recommend that NIJ
consider funding the Center for Civil Force Protection and the
Public Safety Technology Assessment Facility at Sandia National
Laboratories in New Mexico. The Center provides important
physical security counterterrorism assistance to Federal,
State, and local law enforcement.
In addition, the current year level is provided for the
Office of Law Enforcement Technology Commercialization, Inc.
and Facial Recognition.
In addition to the above activities, within the amounts
provided, NIJ is to provide grants for the following projects:
$300,000 for Practitioners Assistance Team (PAT) to
provide technical assistance to State and local
agencies attempting to implement integrated justice
systems;
$1,000,000 for the University of Houston to study
in-car law enforcement technologies;
$1,000,000 for the State of Virginia to develop a
State-wide emergency communications plan to address
communications equipment and interoperability needs of
first responders throughout the State. The plan should
address both the new equipment needs of local first
responder agencies and methods for making current
communications systems interoperable within local
jurisdictions and throughout the State. The State is
encouraged to build upon the experiences and expertise
learned in the National Institute of Justice's
interoperable communications pilot project in the City
of Alexandria (Project Agile);
$500,000 for the Center for Advanced Media Analysis
to fund advanced research in the area of multi-media
capture and analysis of authorized law enforcement
capture;
$750,000 for Lane County, Oregon's Breaking the
Cycle of Juvenile Drug Abuse program to decrease
juvenile crime and drug abuse through early
identification and intervention;
$1,500,000 is for the Center for Task Force
Training Program;
$750,000 to the North Carolina Attorney General's
Office for Telemarketing Fraud Enforcement and Privacy
Project;
$650,000 for the Mistral Security Non-Toxic Drug
Detection and Identification Aerosol Technology;
$350,000 for the Pennsylvania Task Force on Prison
Overcrowding; and
$750,000 for Operation Ceasefire in Charleston, SC
for overtime for response teams.

Of the funds provided for the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children (NCMEC), $2,245,000 is for the
CyberTipline. The conferees recommend that the NCMEC consult
with I-Safe America to provide nationwide Internet Safety
Training in grades K-12.
The conference agreement includes $2,500,000 for training
and technical assistance to develop an effective, coordinated
AMBER Alert program.
Office of Victims of Crime.--The Office of Victims of
Crime (OVC) administers formula and discretionary grants
designed to benefit victims, provide training to professionals
who work with victims, develops projects to enhance victims'
rights and services, and undertakes public education and
awareness activities on behalf of crime victims. In fiscal year
2002, OVC was provided $68,100,000 to respond to the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The conferees direct that the OVC
provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than 60 days after enactment on the status of how the emergency
funds have been spent.
Regional Information Sharing System.--The conference
agreement provides $29,000,000 for the Regional Information
Sharing System (RISS). In addition to the amount provided under
this heading, there is $10,000,000 under the heading ``Domestic
Preparedness'' account to enhance the electronic dissemination
and sharing of terrorist-related information among Federal,
State, and local agencies. The conferees expect that RISS and
other information sharing systems will be eligible to receive
grants under this program in order to enhance State and local
agencies' ability to access and share crime and terrorist
information.
The conferees support the current effort to link the RISS
system with the Law Enforcement On-Line [LEO] information
system, which will greatly expand access to critical law
enforcement information at the Federal, State, and local level.
Management and Administration.--The conference agreement
provides $38,000,000 for the management and administration of
the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). The conferees understand
that OJP is not backfilling vacant positions, and therefore
request a quarterly status report on staffing.
The Department has reported to the Committees on
Appropriations on a competitive sourcing effort. To support
this effort, the conferees must be assured that effectiveness
is improved and savings are attained. The conferees direct that
OJP provide the Committees on Appropriations with detailed
plans on this effort before proceeding with changes.
OFFICE FOR DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS
The conferees have long viewed State and local
jurisdictions' ability to detect, prevent and respond to a
terrorist attack as one of its highest priorities. State and
local responders are first to arrive on the scene when a
terrorist attack occurs and must be prepared to protect life
and property. This function is inherently non-Federal, although
Federal resources and expertise are needed to manage the crises
and provide support to State and local assets when an attack
overwhelms their resources.
The amounts provided by the conferees demonstrate the
continued support for the Office of Domestic Preparedness
(ODP). ODP must continue its vital and successful program for
assisting State and local response agencies.

Total, Domestic Preparedness....................    1,000,000
Equipment--The conferees provide $458,500,000 for ODP
equipment programs. Within these amounts, $10,000,000 is
provided to enhance the dissemination of electronic threat
information among Federal, State, and local responders. The
conferees understand that there is a large proliferation of
local, State, regional, and Federal information sharing
initiatives. The conferees also understand that many of these
systems are being developed independently with no plan to
integrate with other information sharing systems such as RISS
and LEO. This funding is provided to ODP to enhance State and
local agencies' ability to share intelligence information with
each other and with the Department of Homeland Security and the
Department of Justice. The conferees direct that the ODP
coordinate this program with the Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA). The conferees also expect BJA and ODP to continue to
work with State, local, and Federal agencies through the Global
Intelligence Working Group of the Global Justice Information
Sharing Initiative.
Formula Grant Program to States--Of the amounts provided,
$400,000,000 is for the formula based grant program to States.
The conferees direct that not less than 80 percent of equipment
funding provided to the States by formula shall pass through to
local governments.
Coordination--The conferees recognize that a significant
portion of the funds provided under the formula grant program
are used to improve voice and data communications
interoperability among first responders. The conferees support
this effort, but expect ODP to coordinate closely with other
Federal agencies that also provide communications
interoperability grants to first responders (i.e., FEMA, COPS,
BJA, and NIJ), in order to ensure that Federal resources are
being used effectively to improve intra- and inter-
jurisdictional communications interoperability.
Standards--The conferees understand the need for minimum
performance standards, testing, and evaluation in the areas of
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)
protective equipment, as well as voice/data communications
equipment. The conferees, therefore, expect ODP to work closely
with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to test, evaluate, and develop minimum performance standards
for CBRN protective equipment and voice/data communications
equipment for first responders.
Training--The conference agreement provides $233,000,000
for training programs in ODP. This amount includes $125,000,000
for the training consortium. In addition, the conference
agreement includes $5,000,000 for George Washington University
to work in collaboration with George Mason University,
Shenandoah University and other regional organizations to
provide terrorism prevention and response training for multiple
types of first responders including law enforcement, fire,
hazmat, EMS and other types of responders. The conference
agreement includes $3,000,000 for the National Counterterrorism
Policy Center in St. Petersburg, FL, to assist State and local
homeland security and law enforcement officials with their
strategic plans to prevent and detect acts of terrorism. The
conference agreement also includes $7,000,000 for the Center on
Catastrophe Preparedness and Response at New York University
(NYU), to support counterterrorism activities.
Exercises--The conference agreement provides $112,000,000
for State and local exercises regarding an event involving
weapons of mass destruction. Within this amount, $7,000,000 is
provided for the Top Official Exercise Series (TOPOFF). TOPOFF
II is to be conducted in 2003, therefore, the Committees will
consider a reprogramming for additional funds, if ODP finds it
is necessary.
High Threat Urban Areas--Recognizing the vulnerability
and high risk of terrorist attack in large urban areas, the
Department of Defense (DoD) and later ODP provided training and
equipment to the 120 largest U.S. cities through the Nunn-
Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program. While all of the
cities identified in the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program have
received domestic preparedness training, the conferees
recognize that certain large urban areas remain high threat
targets and are inadequately prepared to respond to a weapon of
mass destruction (WMD) event. Therefore, the conferees
recommend $100,000,000 for ODP to develop a follow-on program
to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici program that addresses the unique
equipment, training, planning and exercise needs of selected
large high threat urban areas. The conferees recognize that
large urban areas often cross State lines and involve multiple
local jurisdictions. The conferees expect these plans will
expand upon States' domestic preparedness strategies and that
no funds will be awarded under this program until jurisdictions
have clearly demonstrated a coordinated assessment of threat,
vulnerability, needs, and capabilities. The conferees expect
ODP to consult with the appropriate Federal agencies including
the FBI and agencies within the Department of Homeland Security
in identifying urban areas to be supported through this
initiative. ODP should take into account credible threat;
vulnerability; the presence of infrastructure of national
importance; population; and identified needs of the
jurisdiction's public safety agencies when determining program
eligibility. The conferees expect ODP, in consultation with the
appropriate Federal agencies, including the FBI and agencies
within the Department of Homeland Security, to develop a multi-
year strategy for addressing the unique needs of high threat
urban jurisdictions to be supported by this program.
Research and Development--The conference agreement
provides $23,500,000 for research and development. Within the
level of funding provided, ODP shall consider evaluating
emerging first responding technologies such as hand-held
detection equipment that can detect possible chemical or
biological attacks, and emerging mapping, assessment, rescue
and recovery technologies.
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE
The conference agreement provides a total appropriation
of $2,065,269,000, of which $20,990,000 is derived from prior
year unobligated balances for the State and Local Law
Enforcement Assistance Program. The conference agreement
provides for the following programs:

Total, State and Local Assistance.................    2,044,279
Local Law Enforcement Block Grant.--The conference
agreement includes $400,000,000 for the Local Law Enforcement
Block Grant program. This program provides grants to local law
enforcement agencies to reduce crime, including acts of
terrorism. Of the amount included, $20,000,000 is provided to
NIJ for assisting local units of government to identify,
select, develop, modernize, and purchase new technologies for
use by law enforcement and $80,000,000 is provided for Boys and
Girls Clubs. In addition, the conference agreement includes
$3,000,000 for Citizen Corps programs, including the expansion
of Neighborhood Watch programs and the Volunteers in Policing
program. No funding is provided for Operation TIPS.
State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.--The conference
agreement provides $250,000,000 for the State Criminal Alien
Assistance Program (SCAAP) for the reimbursement to States for
the costs of incarceration of criminal aliens. The budget
request proposed the elimination of this program. The conferees
recognize the Southwest border States incur significant costs
associated with criminal aliens. In addition to these funds,
the conference agreement includes $40,000,000 for the Southwest
Border Prosecution program under the Community Oriented
Policing Services account.
Indian Country Grants.--The recommendation provides
$18,000,000 for Indian Country grants. The conferees understand
that the Comprehensive Indian Resources forCommunity Law
Enforcement (CIRCLE) initiative is working well in the three Indian
communities in which it is deployed. The conferees urge the Department
to consider ways to expand the CIRCLE project into other communities.
In addition, the conferees request that not later than 60 days after
enactment of this Act, the Department submit a proposal to expand the
CIRCLE project by integrating and coordinating resources from across
the Federal agencies for purposes of Indian law enforcement, public
safety, substance abuse, tribal justice systems, and facilities
construction into a small grant program to Indian tribes and tribal
consortia.
Within the amount for prison construction, the conferees
direct that OJP shall review proposals and provide grants if
warranted for the following projects:
--Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in South Dakota for a
Juvenile Detention and Recovery Facility;
--Yankton Sioux Tribe in South Dakota for the
construction of a Juvenile Detention Facility;
--Lower Brule Sioux Tribe for the construction of a
detention facility.

Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, of which $150,914,000
is for discretionary grants and $500,000,000 is for formula
grants. Within the amounts provided for discretionary grants,
OJP is expected to review the following proposals, provide
grants if warranted, and report to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and Senate on its intentions.

OJP was required to submit a report detailing a plan to
address violence against women with particular emphasis on
Alaska, which ranks first in the Nation for domestic violence
and child abuse. The report was to be completed by May 1, 2002,
but has yet to be received by the Committees on Appropriations.
The Department is directed to provide monthly updates on its
progress until the report is completed as required.
Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners.--The
conference agreement includes $65,000,000 for grants to States
and local governments for development and implementation of
residential substance abuse treatment programs within State
correctional facilities and certain local correctional and
detention facilities. Up to 10 percent of the total program
level maybe used for the treatment of parolees. These grants
should only fund treatment for individuals up to 1 year after
they are released from a State prison.
Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant.--The
conference agreement includes $190,000,000 for the Juvenile
Accountability Incentive Block Grant program. The conferees
direct the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention to provide $250,000 to the American Prosecutors
Research Institute to create and report on benchmarks to
measure the use of individual programs and juvenile justice
system performance in up to four pilot States. This funding
shall be provided from the 2 percent set-aside under the
Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program for technical
assistance.
Within the level of funding provided, $25,000,000 is
available for Project ChildSafe, which has been merged with
Project HomeSafe, for the purchase and distribution of gun
safety locks. These funds may only be used to produce and
distribute gun locks based on OJP's interim standard. The
conferees note that no additional funding will be provided
until a final standard is adopted.
Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.--The
conferees are concerned with the growing abuse of prescription
drugs such as OxyContin and the devastating impact it has on
families and communities throughout the country. In orderto
address this problem, the Committees on Appropriations provided
$2,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 for OJP to provide grants to States
creating new prescription drug monitoring programs and to enhance
current prescription drug monitoring programs. Prescription monitoring
programs help prevent and detect the diversion and abuse of
pharmaceutical controlled substances. States that have implemented
prescription monitoring programs have the capability to collect and
analyze prescription data much more efficiently than States without
such programs, where the collection of prescription information
requires the time consuming manual review of pharmacy files. The
conference agreement includes $7,500,000 to expand the Harold Rogers
Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. Recognizing that prescription
drug abusers often cross multiple State borders in order to fill
prescriptions, the conferees encourage States to develop systems that
allow bordering States to share information.
Prison Rape Prevention and Prosecution.--The conferees
understand that experts have conservatively estimated that at
least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been
sexually assaulted in prison and that many inmates have
suffered repeated assaults. Under this estimate, nearly 200,000
inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of
prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been sexually
assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds 1,000,000. The
conferees understand that prison rape contributes to the spread
of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS. The
conferees also recognize that inmates with mental illness and
juvenile inmates are particularly vulnerable to sexual
victimization. The conferees further understand that most
prison staff are not adequately trained or prepared to prevent,
report, or treat inmate sexual assaults and that prison rape
often goes unreported. Finally, the conferees understand that
Congress will legislatively address this issue during the First
Session of the 108th Congress.
In order to immediately address this problem, the
conference agreement includes $13,000,000 for a new prison rape
prevention and prosecution program. This funding is provided
for statistical data collection and analysis, the establishment
of a national clearinghouse of information, and will provide
grants to States, local authorities, prisons, and prison
systems to undertake more effective efforts to prevent prison
rape, investigate such incidents, and punish the perpetrators.
The conferees expect OJP to work with the Committees on
Appropriations in the development of this program.
Senior citizens against marketing scams.--The
recommendation provides $1,995,000 for this program to assist
law enforcement in preventing and stopping marketing scams
against the elderly. The conferees request that some program
sessions be held at the National Advocacy Center. Also, the
conferees direct that this effort be coordinated with the
Federal Trade Commission.
Terrorism Prevention and Response Training for Law
Enforcement and Other Responders.--The conference agreement
includes $15,000,000 for terrorism prevention and response
training for law enforcement and other responders to be
administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The
conferees expect the grant approval process to include a review
of training curricula and materials to ensure that grantees are
using up-to-date training techniques. BJA is encouraged to work
with the Office of Domestic Preparedness in the execution of
this program. This program shall be available for the costs of
developing training, conducting training, and procuring
training equipment and materials.
Within the amounts appropriated, the conferees expects
BJA to examine each of the following proposals, to provide
grants if warranted, and to submit a report to the Committees
on Appropriations on its intentions for each proposal:
$500,000 for the Iowa Central Community College
regional first responder training center;
$1,000,000 for the Onondaga Community College for a
Regional Anti-Terrorism Training Center;

COPS Hiring Program.--The conference agreement includes
$200,000,000 for the hiring of law enforcement officers,
including school resource officers, to prevent acts of
terrorism, and other violent and drug-related crimes. The
budget request did not include any funding for this purpose.
Through its knowledge of the local communities and interaction
with citizens, local law enforcement plays a critical role in
preventing and detecting terrorism and sharing this information
with State and Federal law enforcement. The conferees also
recognize that while local law enforcement responsibilities
have expanded to include counterterrorism since September 11th,
daily crime prevention and law enforcement duties must still be
performed. Further, the conferees recognize that it is local
law enforcement's role to respond to citizen concerns and
alleviate fears related to terrorism and other violent crimes.
The conferees expect the COPS Program Office to ensure the
appropriate emphasis on law enforcement's role in combating
terrorism, violence, and drug crime, and securing our nation's
schools.
In addition, the conference agreement makes 30 percent of
the funding available for law enforcement overtime costs for
training and the prevention of acts of terrorism and other
violent and drug-related crimes. The conferees feel that the
cities of New York, NY, Detroit, MI and Wayne County, MI may be
eligible under this program for anti-terrorism efforts.
The conferees also recognize that State and local law
enforcement agencies depend on technology and communications
equipment to perform their jobs safely and effectively.
Therefore, the conference agreement includes language for a new
communications technology grant program under the COPS Crime-
Fighting Technologies section of this report.
Within the level of funding provided, the conferees
expect the COPS office to provide training to assist school
resource officers in preventing terrorist acts aimed at
schools. The officers will be trained in non-intrusive
defensive measures to reduce the vulnerability of schools to
terrorist attacks and offensive measures to prevent, deter, and
respond to terrorism. The conferees direct that a report be
provided to the Committees on Appropriations no later than 60
days after enactment of this Act to include a spending plan for
this effort and the hiring and overtime effort described above.
Police Corps.--The conference agreement includes
$15,000,000 for the Police Corps program. The conferees
understand that sufficient prior year unobligated balances
exist to allow the program to maintain at least its current
level. The conference agreement includes bill language, as
requested, providing that funding agreements shall include
thefunding for outyear program costs of new recruits. This language is
necessary to prevent the program from incurring unfunded future
liabilities as new recruits enter the program.
The conferees understand that in fiscal year 2002 there
were 22 States training recruits in the Police Corps programs.
Within the available funding, including carryover balances, OJP
is expected to fund additional programs as more State programs
meet OJP program criteria. The conferees understand that Public
Law 107-273 authorizes increased payments for scholarships,
educational reimbursements, and stipends for trainees. However,
the Administration's budget request did not include additional
funding to accommodate these increased costs. Therefore, in
order to ensure there are sufficient resources to fund
additional training programs, the conference agreement directs
OJP to continue to provide payments at the levels authorized in
fiscal year 2002. In addition, the conference agreement directs
OJP to standardize the funding provided for recruit training
and require State matching funds for training costs. The
conference agreement directs OJP to submit a Police Corps
financial plan no later than 180 days after enactment of this
Act.
The conferees expect OJP to work with State Police Corps
programs to ensure these programs are providing effective and
up-to-date terrorism prevention and response training. The
conferees also recognizes that every State will not implement a
Police Corps program and that the vast majority of law
enforcement training will not be performed in Police Corps
programs. The conferees direct OJP to submit a report no later
than 180 days after enactment of this Act, describing how
successful Police Corps training techniques can be incorporated
in State and local law enforcement academies in order to
maximize the number of recruits that receive this advanced
training. The report shall also describe OJP's efforts to
incorporate terrorism prevention and response training into the
Police Corps program and discuss the feasibility of
establishing regional Police Corps training centers.
Indian Country.--The conference agreement includes
$35,000,000 to be used to improve law enforcement capabilities
on Indian lands and native villages, both for hiring uniformed
officers, including village public safety officers, and for the
purchase of equipment and training for new and existing
officers. The conferees recommend that five percent of these
funds be provided directly to tribal judicial systems to assist
Tribal courts with the increased caseload associated with the
increased arrests as a result of the additional funds for
tribal law enforcement.
Methamphetamine Enforcement and Clean-Up.--The conference
agreement includes $57,132,000 for State and local law
enforcement programs to combat methamphetamine production and
distribution, to target drug ``hot spots,'' and to remove and
dispose of hazardous materials at clandestine methamphetamine
labs.
Within the amount provided, the conference agreement
includes $20,000,000 to reimburse the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) for assistance to State and local law
enforcement for proper removal and disposal of hazardous
materials at clandestine methamphetamine labs.
In addition, within the amount provided, the conferees
expect the COPS Program Office, in consultation with DEA, to
examine each of the following proposals, to provide grants if
warranted, and to submit a report to the Committees on
Appropriations on its intentions for each proposal:
$415,000 for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drug Control to properly train and equip

COPS Interoperable Communications Technology Program.--
The conference agreement provides $20,000,000 for the Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Interoperable
Communications Technology program. This program should be
designed and implemented by the COPS Office, in coordination
with the National Institute of Justice's Advanced Generation of
Interoperability for Law Enforcement (AGILE) program and the
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The conferees seek to
utilize the expertise of all three organizations so as to
create a grant program that is highly responsive to the
immediate needs of the State and local law enforcement
community.
This program should address the critical need of law
enforcement to improve cross-jurisdictional communication and
information sharing. The conferees direct the COPS Office to
develop and submit to the Committee, no later than 60 days
after the implementation of this Act, proposed guidelines for
the program. In addition, this program should be coordinated
with other Federal grant programs designed to address
communications interoperability, so as to develop a
comprehensive strategy for improving the current state of
public safety communications systems. Consistent with the COPS
Office's existing grant programs, the COPS Interoperable
Communications Technology program should include a 25 percent
match requirement.
The conferees understand and support the need for minimum
standards for law enforcement communications technology.
Therefore, within the amount provided, the conferees direct
that $5,000,000 be transferred to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology to continue the efforts of the Office
of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) regarding the development
of a comprehensive suite of minimum standards for law
enforcement communications. In addition, to continue the
research and development of improved communications
technologies, the conferees direct that within the amounts
provided, $3,000,000 is to enhance the current program level
for NIJ's AGILE program.
Law Enforcement Technology Program.--The conference
agreement includes $189,954,000 for the COPS Law Enforcement
Technology Program for the continued development of
technologies, communications equipment, and automated systems
to assist State and local law enforcement agencies. The
conferees realize that a large portion of the projects funded
under this account are for enhanced communications systems. The
conferees expect that, wherever feasible, voice/data
communications equipment purchased with funds from this account
be incorporated into an intra- or inter-jurisdictional strategy
for communications interoperability among Federal, State, and
local public safety first responders.
Within the amounts provided under this account, grants

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $34,999,000 for the
Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) for
fiscal year 2003. The recommendation provides additional trade

responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international
trade, commodity, and direct investment policy, and leading or
directing negotiations with other countries on such matters.
International Trade Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $54,000,000 for the
International Trade Commission for fiscal year 2003. The

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
International Trade Administration
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement recommends $370,192,000 in total
resources for the programs of the International Trade
Administration (ITA) for fiscal year 2003. The recommendation
includes $362,192,000 to be derived from direct appropriations
and $8,000,000 from fee collections. Of the amount of fee
collections, $5,000,000 is anticipated from a new fee proposal
requested in the budget. The agreement adopts the consolidation
of this effort within the Under Secretary/Administration
heading, as proposed.
The conference agreement includes additional funding to
monitor and enforce trade agreements, and to expand access for
U.S. companies to foreign markets. In addition, funding is
provided to ensure the United States Foreign Commercial Service
has adequate resources to fund increased security and operating
costs for overseas posts. The recommendation also assumes a
realignment of $5,975,000 from base funds for information and
communication systems and merges funding under the Under
Secretary/Executive Administration to ensure greater
efficiency, as proposed in the budget.
The following table reflects the distribution of the
recommendation by subactivity:
Trade Development.--The conference agreement provides a
total of $67,669,000 for this component and an additional
$450,000 is available from prior year unobligated balances. The
recommendation includes $500,000 for increased inflationary
costs. The conferees provide $10,000,000 for the National
Textile Centers, and $3,000,000 for the Textile/Technology
Center (TC2); $500,000 for an international competitiveness
program; $500,000 for a trade processing center; $250,000 for
an export database; and $500,000 for a travel industry
statistics component, as provided in the prior year.
Of the funds provided, $500,000 is to develop a new steel
industry information management system. Further, the
recommendation assumes a transfer of $550,000 from this heading
to the UnderSecretary/Executive Administration heading for
information and communication activities, as proposed.
Market Access Compliance.--The conference agreement
includes $31,204,000 for Market Access Compliance. Of the
amounts provided, $557,000 is to provide for increasing costs
for ongoing operations; $930,000 is provided to expand markets
by combating regulatory barriers; $576,000 is provided to
support negotiation efforts for the Free Trade Area of the
Americas; $900,000 is provided to support new efforts relating
to the Africa Growth Opportunity Act; and $850,000 is for new
efforts relating to the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). The
conferees determined that it is more prudent to use direct
appropriations for the new CBI efforts instead of relying on
anticipated fees for this purpose, as proposed.
The recommendation assumes a transfer of $350,000 for
information and communication activities from this heading to
the Under Secretary/Executive Administration heading, as
proposed.
Import Administration.--The conference agreement includes
$44,229,000 for the Import Administration. Of the amounts
provided, $7,500,000 is to continue overseas compliance and
import surge monitoring and enforcement, including $3,500,000
to monitor import data and customs flows for surges in key
markets and sectors, such as steel and lumber, and take
immediate action when such surges are detected. Such action
should include using resources to expedite unfair trade cases
so U.S. companies can receive relief at the earliest possible
date. The conferees expect Import Administration to vigorously
monitor foreign subsidies so that action can be taken if the
subsidies violate trade agreements.
Of the amounts provided, $2,500,000 is provided to review
and evaluate in-depth Chinese and Japanese compliance with
antidumping and countervailing duty commitments. China and
Japan represent the majority of unfair trade actions, and the
conferees believe there is an urgent need for greater attention
to both Japanese and Chinese trade practices.
Of the amounts provided, $1,633,000 for expanded
compliance efforts, including $875,000 for additional personnel
to increase enforcement of antidumping (AD) and countervailing
(CV) duty laws, and $758,000 for the costs of five full-time
equivalents to increase legal support for increased World Trade
Organization litigation.
The recommendation also includes a transfer of $775,000
for information and communication activities from this heading
to the heading of Under Secretary/Executive Administration
heading, as proposed.
U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US & FCS).--The
conference agreement includes $202,040,000 for the US & FCS. Of
the amounts provided, $900,000 is to be derived from
unobligated prior year balances. The conferees provide an
additional 4 full-time equivalents and $1,125,000 for expanded
compliance efforts. The recommendation assumes $6,000,000 for
increased security costs and other uncontrollable costs of
overseas posts, and $1,000,000 is to continue funding for a
rural export program.
In addition, $1,674,000 is provided to expand U.S.
commercial presence throughout the continent of Africa; and
$1,650,000 is provided to cover the costs of a new presence in
El Salvador, as proposed. The conference agreement includes
direct appropriations for new Caribbean Basin Initiative
efforts instead of relying on fees for this purpose, as
proposed.
The conferees direct ITA to establish a partnership with
communities in the City of Chicago and in Cook County,
Illinois, to enhance trade relationships between the United
States and African countries, focusing initially on efforts
with Nigeria.
The conferees continue to direct that the US & FCS should
continue and expand its Global Diversity Initiative to support
minority-owned businesses in underserved areas, including
inner-city urban areas, empowerment zones, enterprise
communities, and Indian reservations. This initiative should
continue to include support for companies that are export-ready
and hoping to enter into and/or expand international
operations.
Further, the conferees direct the Commercial Service to
continue its work on the Appalachian-Turkish Trade Project, a
project to promote opportunities to expand trade, encourage
business interests, stimulate foreign studies, and to build a
lasting and mutually meaningful relationship between the
Appalachian states and the Republic of Turkey, as well as the
neighboring regions, such as Greece.
Executive Direction/Administration.--A total of
$25,050,000 is recommended for the administrative and policy
functions of ITA. The conference agreement includes $5,975,000
from base transfers from other activities to centralize
information and communication activities under this heading, as
proposed. In addition, $1,075,000 is for increased training
efforts.
The conferees remain concerned that ITA's efforts to
increase trade between the United States and its trading
partners are coming at the expense of the promotion of human
rights. The advancement of human rights and the development of
economies are not mutually exclusive goals. In addition, the
conferees understand that the majority of employees in the US &
FCS have not received any formalized training to assist them in
promoting human rights. Therefore, the conferees direct ITA to
develop a comprehensive training program for all officers and
employees to ensure that, when counseling U.S. businesses on
market conditions within a particular country, they must
include information on human rights, in addition to information
on rule of law issues and corporate responsibility. Of the
amounts provided for training efforts, $500,000 is to implement
a formal human rights training program. ITA is strongly urged
to work with non-government organizations, the State
Department, and private entities to develop a comprehensive
training program. The conferees direct the Secretary of
Commerce to provide quarterly reports on the progress of the
implementation of this new program.
In addition, language is included in the bill, as carried
since fiscal year 1999 designating the amounts available for
each unit within ITA. The conferees remind ITA that any changes
from the funding distribution provided in the bill and report,
including carryover balances, are subject to the standard
reprogramming procedures set forth in section 605 of this Act.
In addition, ITA is directed to report to the Committees on
Appropriations, not later than April 11, 2003, a spending plan
for all ITA units, which incorporates any carryover balances
from previous fiscal years.
Trade Missions.--The conferees direct all trade missions
involving Department of Commerce agencies must be initiated,
coordinated and administered through ITA.
Buying Power Maintenance.--The conferees direct ITA to
report on the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on ITA's
budget on a quarterly basis. The conferees expect that any
exchange rate gains reflected in this report will be reserved
to balance future exchange rate losses.
Trade Show Revenues.--The conferees direct ITA to submit
a report by the date of the budget submission on the amount of
trade show revenues that are collected on an annual basis,
expenditures from these revenues, and how they displayed in the
budget.
Bureau of Industry and Security
OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement includes $79,328,000 for the
Operations and Administration of the Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS), of which $4,675,000 is from prior year
unobligated balances. Within the total amount available, the
recommendation includes the following:
Export Administration.--$33,399,000 is provided for
export administration activities, of which $1,875,000 is from
prior year unobligated balances. The recommendation includes
$1,140,000 for export licensing personnel, as proposed.
Export Enforcement.--$31,122,000 is provided for export
enforcement activities. The recommendation continues funding
for the Dubai and Cairo attache offices, which received initial
funding in Public Law 107-117. Of which, the recommendation
provides $3,356,000 and 13 full-time equivalents to maximize
legal export opportunities while ensuring that illegal exports
are prevented.
BIS is expected to enhance its export control efforts,
including a new initiative under which BIS will send a limited
number of export enforcement agents (attaches) overseas to
conduct end--use checks. The conferees direct that, prior to
the assignment of any attache at U.S. missions overseas, BIS is
expected to provide a detailed report to the Committees on
Appropriations detailing the location and responsibilities of
each attache. Additionally, the report should detail the
arrangement between Department of Commerce andthe Department of
State concerning accommodations for these personnel within Department
of State facilities to ensure there is sufficient space.
The conferees direct BIS to conduct a comprehensive study
on the health, competitiveness, and the contribution of the
U.S. textile and apparel industry to the U.S. economy and in
particular to the U.S. armed forces. The study should include a
review of whether the United States is increasing its
dependency on foreign sources for critical textile-related
materials; potential threats to internal security from
increased foreign sourcing and dependency; and whether the
Berry amendment and other Buy-American restrictions are being
effectively enforced by the Department of Defense. The
conferees direct that the study be completed no later than July
1, 2003, and direct that $750,000 be used for this purpose.
Management and Policy Coordination--$6,879,000 is
provided for Management and Policy Coordination, of which
$2,800,000 is from prior year unobligated balances. The
recommendation includes $500,000 for a new information
technology initiative.
In addition to the amounts provided under management and
policy coordination, $7,928,000 is provided for critical
infrastructure protection efforts. The conferees note that the
primary responsibility for non-proliferation activities lies
with the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and
the Department of State, and believes that BIS participation in
such activities should be done using funds provided from those
agencies. Language is included to rename the Bureau of Export
Administration as the Bureau of Industry and Security.
Economic Development Administration
The conference agreement includes $320,765,000 for the
programs and administrative expenses of the Economic
Development Administration (EDA) for fiscal year 2003, as
described below:
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
A total of $290,000,000 is included for fiscal year 2003
for Economic Development Assistance Programs. The conferees
continue the traditional programs of the Economic Development
Administration to provide needed assistance to communities
struggling with long-term economic dislocation, as well as
sudden and severe economic dislocation. Of the amounts
provided, $205,000,000 is for Public Works and Economic
Development, $40,900,000 is for Economic Adjustment Assistance,
$24,000,000 is for planning, $9,100,000 is for technical
assistance, including university centers, $10,500,000 is for
trade adjustment assistance, and $500,000 is for research.
The conferees expect EDA to continue to assist
communities impacted by economic dislocations related to coal
industry downswings and timber industry downturns due to
environmental concerns at no less than the fiscal year 2002
level. In addition, the conferees expect EDA to focus on
communities impacted by United States-Canadian trade-related
issues, communities in New England, the mid-Atlantic, Hawaii,
and Alaska impacted by fisheries regulations, and communities
in the Southeast impacted by downturns due to NAFTA.
The conferees remind EDA that no funding is provided for
a special headquarters reserve fund.
The conferees laud EDA for its continued efforts to
strengthen private sector business activity and development on
Indian lands, and urges that it act expeditiously to develop an
implementation plan for the recently enacted Native American
Business Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act.
The conferees recently approved the Economic Development
Administration's headquarters reorganization plan, based upon
the agency's commitment not to involuntarily terminate
employees and not to increase the current number of political
appointees. The conferees direct EDA to report to the
Committees on Appropriations within 120 days from the date of
enactment of this Act, on the status of the reorganization,
including relocations.
The conferees note that EDA was reauthorized in 1999
(Public Law 105-393) through fiscal year 2003. That
authorization locks into place the work that the authorization
and appropriations committees have done to reform EDA programs
to ensure that funds provided under this account be targeted to
the most severely distressed areas, which, absent the
assistance provided by the EDA, would have little to no access
to resources for critical infrastructure development and
capacity building. This puts the program on firm ground to
carry out its purpose to provide the ``seed capital'' to
distressed areas to allow local communities to increase their
ability to create new economic opportunities and jobs in
accordance with local priorities.
The conferees direct EDA to discontinue the use of single
purpose grant loans.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $30,765,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Economic Development
Administration. The conferees continue direction to the
Administration to aggressively pursue all opportunities for
reimbursement, deobligations and use of non-appropriated
resources, including the care and protection of collateral
account, to be able to maximize the operating level.
In addition, the conferees remind EDA of the requirements
under section 605 of this Act regarding reorganization
proposals.
The conference agreement retains language in the bill to
provide the authority to use this appropriation to monitor
projects approved under Title I of the Public Works Employment
Act of 1976, Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, and the
Community Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1977.
Minority Business Development Agency
MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
The conference agreement includes $28,906,000 for the
Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) for fiscal year
2003. Of the amounts provided, $16,794,000 is provided for
business development, and $12,112,000 is provided for advocacy,
research, and information programs. The conference agreement
assumes that the Entrepreneurial Technology Apprenticeship
Program (ETAP) will continue to be supported at the fiscal year
2002 level.
ECONOMIC AND INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE
The conference agreement includes under this section, the
Department of Commerce agencies responsible for the nation's
basic economic and technical information infrastructure, as
well as the administrative functions to oversee the development
of telecommunications and information policy.

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $72,158,000 for the
economic and statistical analysis programs of the Department of
Commerce, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), for
fiscal year 2003. Due to the Nation's economic situation, the
conferees support the request to ensure policy makers have
access to better and timely economic data. Therefore, the
recommendation includes $4,776,000 to accelerate the release of
major economic indicators; $2,116,000 to improve the processing
systems used for statistical processing; and $2,751,000 to
allow the United States to meet international agreements
including the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Economic and Statistics Administration (ESA) is
responsible for the collection, tabulation and publication of a
wide variety of economic, demographic and social statistics and
provides support to the Secretary of Commerce and other
Government officials in interpreting the state of the economy
and developing economic policy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis
and Under Secretary for Economic Affairs are funded in this
account.
Bureau of the Census
The conference agreement includes a total operating level
of $596,299,000 for the Bureau of the Census, of which
$41,817,000 is from prior year unobligated balances from the
2000 Census.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $183,000,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Bureau of the Census for fiscal
year 2003. The agreement includes $128,234,000 for current
economic statistics, and $54,766,000 for current demographic
statistics. The conferees direct the Bureau to continue to
streamline and prioritize programs to ensure the highest
priority core activities are supported. The conferees expect
the Bureau to be fully reimbursed for any non-core survey by
any other Federal agency or private organization.
In addition, the conferees are concerned that key reports
on manufacturing, general economic and foreign trade statistics
are maintained and issued on a timely basis.
This recommendation provides for the current statistical
programs of the Bureau of the Census, which includes
measurement of the Nation's economy and the demographic
characteristics of the population. Theseprograms are intended
to provide a broad base of economic, demographic, and social
information used for decision-making by governments, private
organizations, and individuals.

\1\ The fiscal year 2003 budget request included $9,500,000 for an
anticipated worker's compensation payment due to the Department of
Labor. To date, no justification has been provided to substantiate this
request. No funding is provided for this purpose.
\2\ The budget request includes a total of $123,866,000 for the American
Community Survey. The Census Bureau has proposed to alter the current
process of conducting the decennial census. The current proposal is to
abolish the long-form survey, but continue the short form survey as part
of the 2010 census and replace the long-form survey with an annual
survey of 3,000,000 households. The current proposal would require the
American Community Survey to be considered a mandatory requirement for
those households being surveyed. The conferees acknowledge that
sufficient information is not available to weight the benefits of a
mandatory survey versus a voluntary survey. Therefore, the conferees
include $1,000,000 to test the response rates of both a voluntary and a
mandatory survey. The conferees direct the Secretary of Commerce to
report to the Committees on Appropriations as soon as the results of the
study are available.
Subgroup Enumeration--The conferees understand the Census
Bureau continues to face difficulty in accurately enumerating
Hispanic subgroups and urges the Census Bureau to continue to
work to address these concerns in preparation for the decennial
census.
Hiring--The conferees recommend that the Census Bureau
move decisively to improve the representation of minorities in
senior management at the Census Bureau and to improve the
representation of minorities in all areas of research. The
conferees suggest that the Census Bureau take advantage of the
Presidential Management Intern program and the Joint Program on
Survey Methodology to achieve these goals.
National Telecommunications and Information Administration
The conference agreement includes a total of $73,759,000
for the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) for fiscal year 2003.
The National Telecommunications and Information (NTIA) is
responsible for developing domestic and international
telecommunications and information policy for the Executive
Branch, ensuring the efficient and effective use of the Federal
radio spectrum, and administering Federal programs that
supports telecommunications facilities for public broadcasting.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $14,700,000 for the
Salaries and Expenses appropriation of the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
The conference agreement includes $625,000 and two full-
time equivalents to improve NTIA's management of the Federal
spectrum. Due to fiscal constraints, no additional funding is
provided to upgrade existing facilities on the Table Mountain
radio quiet zone. The conferees direct the Administration to
aggressively pursue all opportunities for reimbursement,
deobligations, and use of non-appropriated resources, to be
able to maximize the operating level for this purpose.
The conference agreement assumes an additional
$26,270,000 will be available to the NTIA through
reimbursements from other agencies for the costs of providing
spectrum management, analysis and research services to those
agencies, reflecting implementation of a policy of 80%
reimbursement for such services that began in fiscal year 1999.
PUBLIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement includes $43,556,000 for
planning and construction grants for public television, radio,
and non-broadcast facilities. This amount will allow the
continuation of the existing equipment and facilities
replacement program.
Challenges are particularly great for those broadcasters
who are located in, or who serve, largely rural areas. As in
past years, the conferees continue to urge NTIA to place
emphasis on the needs of these stations, and to support
focusing resources on distance learning initiatives targeting
rural areas.
INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS
The conference agreement recommends $15,503,000 for the
Information Infrastructure Grant program for demonstrations of
new telecommunications technology applications. The
recommendation is the same as the fiscal year 2002 funding
level. The accompanying bill does not include language to
terminate the program, as proposed.
The conferees note that there is some overlap between
this program and technology programs under the Department of
Justice, Community Oriented Policing Services and the Regional
Information Sharing System with respect to grants for public
safety. The conferees expect NTIA to give preference to
applications relating to public safety only when there is no
other source of funding available for such applications.
The conferees retain language making the funds provided
under this heading available for program administration and
related program support activities at the fiscal year 2002
level. The bill also includes language carried in previous
appropriation acts which will allow up to five percent of this
appropriation to be available for telecommunications research
activities directly related to the development of a national
information infrastructure (NII).
United States Patent and Trademark Office
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $1,182,000,000 for the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in fiscal
year 2003. The recommendation does not include the
Administration's proposed language establishing a new fee
structure to significantly increase fees for both trademark and
patent applications resulting in additional fee collections of
$197,000,000. To date, the fee structure changes and many of
the other changes outlined in the 21st Century Strategic Plan
have not been authorized.
In fiscal year 2002, the Congress directed the PTO to
develop a 5-Year Strategic Plan for the PTO with three core
objectives: (1) prepare the agency to handle the workload
associated with the 21st century economy, (2) improve patent
quality, and (3) reduce patent and trademark pendency.
The 21st Century Strategic Plan calls for some of the
most sweeping changes to the patent review process in 200
years.
The conferees support efforts to shift resources to high
priority areas and a more gradual increase in staffing to
ensure that examiners have the expertise, tools, and training
necessary to produce quality patents on a timely basis. This
approach is consistent with the outline of the 21st Century
Strategic Plan released in June 2002.
Of the amount recommended in the bill, $1,015,229,000 is
to be derived from offsetting fees collected in fiscal year
2003 and $166,771,000 is to be derived from carryover funds
from prior years. Of the amounts provided, $14,000,000 is for
the completion of the trademark electronic processing system;
and $4,499,000 is for increased workload costs and continued
implementation costs of electronic patent filing system.
Within the amounts available, the conferees expect that
USPTO continue its relationship with the National Inventor's
Hall of Fame and Inventure Place, and the International
Intellectual Property Institute at least at the same level as
in fiscal year 2002.
The conferees understand that funding for a global
intellectual program provided in fiscal year 2002 was not
obligated. Therefore, the conferees direct USPTO to use prior
year funding to offset any additional costs necessary to
maintain the above-mentioned partnerships. The conferees remind
the USPTO that any changes from the funding distribution
provided in the bill and report, including carryover balances,
are subject to the standard reprogramming procedures set forth
in section 605 of this Act.
In addition, USPTO is directed to submit to the
Committee, not later than April 11, 2003, a spending plan,
which incorporates any carryover balances from previous fiscal
years and any increase to the patent or trademark fee
structure.
The conferees commend USPTO for its successful trademark
telework program in support of section 359 of Public Law 106-
346. Yet, despite this successful program, the patent employees
are not gaining the benefits of a similar program. The
conferees understand that telework programs can significantly
help to alleviate crowded highways in the greater Washington
area. Further, the private sector has shown that these programs
can increase the performance and morale of employees.
Therefore, the conferees direct the USPTO to provide a report
to the Committees on Appropriations, not later than April 11,
2003, containing a detailed plan to implement a telework
program for patent employees, including examiners.
The USPTO is charged with administering the patent and
trademark laws of the United States. USPTO examines patent
applications, grants patent protection for qualified
inventions; and disseminates technological information
disclosed in patents. USPTO also examines trademark
applications and provides Federal registration to owners of
qualified trademarks.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The conference agreement includes under this section of
Title II the Department of Commerce agencies responsible for
scientific and technological research and programs.
Technology Administration
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees recommend $9,886,000 for the Technology
Administration's Office of the Under Secretary/Office of
Technology Policy. Of the amounts provided, $1,000,000 is for
the Global Technology Summit, and $1,000,000 is for the
Networked Economy Summit.
The conferees did not support the proposed language
making a portion of the funding under this account available
until expended.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
The conference agreement includes $712,134,000 for the
appropriations accounts under the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) for fiscal year 2003.
A description of each account and the Committee
recommendation follows:
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH AND SERVICES
The conference agreement includes $359,411,000 for the
Scientific and Technical Research and Services (core programs)
appropriation of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
The following is a breakdown of the amounts provided
under this account by activity.

____________________________________________________
Total, STRS.........................................    $359,411
Under the Building and Fire Research heading, the
recommendation includes $2,500,000 for a wind research project,
$3,000,000 for research efforts related to the World Trade
Center collapse investigation.
Under the Computer and Applied Math heading, the
recommendation includes $1,000,000 for expert review teams,
$2,100,000 for wireless technologies and computer security
checklists and guidelines, and $500,000 in support of voting
machine standards.
Under the Chemical Science and Technology Program
heading, the recommendation includes $1,000,000 to restore
reductions in environmental measurements at the Hollings Marine
Laboratory.
Under the Electronics and Engineering heading, $3,000,000
is for salaries associated with the Office of Law Enforcement
Standards to ensure that NIST has the critical personnel with
the expertise to implement law enforcement standards
initiatives proposed by their partner federal agencies.
In addition, under the Research Support heading, the
recommendation includes $2,400,000 for a telework project,
$6,500,000 for a certain critical infrastructure program, and
includes $15,000,000 for the Advanced Measurement Laboratory in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Further, the conferees have heard reports that U.S.
companies may not be as competitive as non-U.S. companies in
emerging markets because U.S. standards are not incorporated in
many international agreements. The conferees request NIST with
input from the ITA, to provide to the Committees on
Appropriations, no later than April 11, 2003, a plan detailing
efforts that ensure U.S. business interests are represented in
new international standard negotiations.
Competitive sourcing. The conferees understand that there
are efforts within the Department of Commerce and other
Departments, to use the implementation of the President's
Management Initiative for Competitive Outsourcing (the A-76
process) as a way to reduce staff by more than 50 percent. This
initiative is designed to compete or directly convert 15
percent of those positions identified as commercially
competitive. However, the conferees understand that efforts are
underway to identify roughly 75 percent of NIST's positions as
commercial for purposes of this initiative. While the conferees
certainly agree that there are certain advantages to
competitive outsourcing, there is a concern that blind
implementation could severely inhibit the operations of the
Institute in the future. The conferees direct NIST to provide a
detailed plan to the Committees on Appropriations prior to any
changes in support of ``competitive outsourcing''.
For more than a century, the scientists, engineers, and
supporting organizations of the Institute have established
standards that affect nearly every aspect of life and work in
America, from the doses of radiation in medical X-rays to the
level of protection in bullet-proof vests used by police
officers. NIST's mission plays an ever more critical role today
by supporting our homeland security efforts through the
development of standards for mail irradiation, guidelines for
cyber security for Federal IT systems, and by conducting the
Federal investigation of the collapse of the World Trade Center
buildings.
The recommendation does not include a requested increase
to the allowable amount to be transferred to the working
capital fund.
Industrial Technology Services
The conference agreement includes $286,623,000 for the
Industrial Technology Services appropriation of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program--Recent
economic downturns have had a devastating effect on the
manufacturing sector. Therefore, to ameliorate some of the
effect on this sector, the conferees have included $106,623,000
for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program to fund all
existing centers.
Advanced Technology Program--The conference agreement
includes $180,000,000 for the program, of which $60,700,000 is
for new awards. This amount, when combined with approximately
$34,000,000 in prior year funds, provides ATP awards at the
fiscal year 2002 level. Within the amounts made available,
$45,000,000 shall be used for administrative costs, internal
laboratory support, and for Small Business Innovation Research
Program requirements.
Construction of Research Facilities
The conference agreement includes $66,100,000 for
construction, renovation, and maintenance of NIST facilities.
Of the amounts provided, $11,090,000 is for urgently needed
construction and renovation projects at the Boulder, Colorado
laboratory, including a new primary electrical service and the
first phase of the central utility plant, these investments
should help minimize the number of brownouts affecting the
campus; $4,000,000 is to offset fit-up costs related to the
Advanced Measurement Laboratory in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to
be completed by December 2003; and $22,194,000 for the backlog
of safety, capacity, maintenance, and major repair projects
account for the two NIST campuses.
The conferees direct NIST to report to the Committees on
Appropriations on the progress of these construction projects
on a quarterly basis.
Up to $282,000 is available to transfer to the working
capital fund, as proposed.
This account supports all NIST activities by providing
the state of the art facilities necessary to carry out the NIST
mission.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
The conference agreement includes a total of
$3,154,551,000 for necessary expenses for the seven
appropriation items of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), including transfers totaling
$65,000,000.
Of the amounts provided, $479,201,000 is provided in
support of the separate conservation category created in Title
VIII of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2001.
Operations, Research, and Facilities
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement includes $2,316,519,000 for the
coastal, fisheries, marine, weather, satellite, and other NOAA
programs funded in this account. The agreement includes a
transfer of $65,000,000 from balances in the account entitled,
``Promote and Develop Fishery Products and Research Pertaining
to American Fisheries''. The recommendation assumes
deobligations of $17,000,000, as proposed, and $3,000,000 from
prior year receipts relating to the coastal zone management
program.
The bill continues language to allow NOAA to retain gifts
and contributions made under the Marine Sanctuary Program. The
conferees continue to direct NOAA to fully utilize the
authorities provided for this program.
Language is also included in the bill specifying the
total amount of direct obligations available for each of the
NOAA line offices and other related activities funded through
this account. The conferees continue to take this action to
provide greater clarity and accountability in budgeting and
management for the diverse activities funded in this account.
In addition, the bill also retains language regarding the
practice of assessing NOAA line organizations, programs,
projects, and activities, to support NOAA and line office
overhead and programs over and above the amounts specifically
provided, and regarding the funding and personnel in Executive
Direction and Administration. The conference agreement caps
administrative expenses at $243,000,000. NOAA is directed to
submit a spend plan to the Committees on Appropriations for
these expenses at a level of detail comparable to that of the
House and Senate NOAA tables. The plan shall be delivered not
later than March 15, 2003.
The conferees remind NOAA that administrative charges
levied against certain activities assigned in the bill are
limited to no more than five percent. In addition, language is
also included regarding use of deobligations in excess of
amounts estimated in the budget.
In addition to the direction given in this section of the
report, the conferees direct NOAA to comply with sections
addressing the reprogramming and transfer requirements under
Section 204 of this Act.
The following identifies the activities, sub-activities,
and projects funded in this appropriation.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE
The conference agreement includes a total of $417,933,000
for activities of the National Ocean Service (NOS) for fiscal
year 2003.
Mapping and Charting--The recommendation includes
$79,433,000 for mapping and charting activities. The conferees
include $20,450,000 to address the hydrographic survey backlog
detailed in the National Survey Plan. The recommendation is
consistent with the conferees decision that at least 50 percent
of the hydrographic surveying should be contracted out to
private companies. The conferees direct NOAA to report to the
Committees on Appropriations within six months after the
enactment of this Act on the progress being made to reduce the
backlog.
Of the amounts provided for mapping and charting
activities, the conferees include $7,500,000 to allow NOAA to
continue its efforts to lease or charter a U.S.-purpose-built
U.S. flag hydrographic survey vessel, which is capable of
performing the full scope of necessary hydrographic services.
The conferees expect the vessel to be equipped with a suite of
state-of-the-art survey equipment capable of providing quality
data from inshore waters to full ocean depth. The conferees
direct NOAA to examine lease and charter options of longer than
one-year, which may reduce the annual cost. The conferees
direct NOAA to award the time charter contract on its current
schedule and report by no later than April 11, 2003, on options
for increasing the length of a lease or charter and whether
savings might result from such an increase. In addition, NOAA
is expected to follow the requirements of Section 303(b)(3) of
the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act and contract for
hydrographers on any leased or chartered vessel in accordance
with title IX of the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949. Finally, the conferees adopts NOAA's
proposal to hire a vessel that is capable of work in both the
Gulf of Mexico and the Alaska waters. The conferees understand
that the leased or chartered vessel will begin its work in the
Gulf of Mexico no later then April 2003, but would survey in
Alaska from April 1, 2004, through November 1, 2004. After
that, the conferees expect the total vessel time to be split
between the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.
Of the amounts provided, $3,200,000 is for bathymetric
surveys off the Northeast Coast of the United States and around
the Aleutian Chain in accordance with the data needs identified
by a Joint Hydrographic Center on the potential expansion of
United States lands beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone. Within
the funding recommendation for Shoreline Mapping, the conferees
recommend that NOS focus on mapping the shoreline of the North
Slope of Alaska.
Geodesy.--The conferees understand the State of Alabama
has begun an effort to develop a comprehensive statewide
Geographic Information System database and clearinghouse that
will reduce duplication of resources among state agencies,
improve quality, and reduce costs. The National Geodetic Survey
has begun talks with representatives of the State of Alabama,
including the Alabama Department of Revenue, on this effort and
the conferees encourage the National Geodetic Survey to
continue to support this effort as appropriate.
Tide and Current Data.--The conferees include $19,750,000
for this activity. The recommendation will enable NOS to
implement and maintain the necessary quality controls for real-
time tide and current data systems. Funding is included to
continue implementation of the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time
System (PORTS) program and continues the National Water Level
Operation Network (NWLON) in the Great Lakes.
Coral Reefs.--Prior to obligation of the funding provided
for this program, the conferees direct NOAA to submit a
spending plan to the Houseand Senate Committees on
Appropriations. A total of $14,000,000 is provided for this program, of
which $2,000,000 is from unobligated prior year balances.
Ocean and Coastal Observing Systems.--The conferees
support the establishment of an integrated interagency ocean
and coastal observing system that will provide critical
information to a wide variety of users of ocean and coastal
information and services. Better information on the current and
future state of the ocean and its role in environmental change
is needed for policy makers. Adequate predictive capability is
a prerequisite to the development of sound policies at the
national and regional level, policies ranging from maritime
commerce to public health, from fisheries to safety of life and
property, from climate change to national security.
Broad scale discussions have been underway for almost
three decades on this topic, but coordinated attention at the
Federal level has begun in earnest only in recent years. The
Office of Science and Technology Policy was directed to develop
an interagency plan for the research, technology demonstration,
and ultimately, the implementation of an integrated ocean
observing system. The conferees direct NOAA to work with its
partners on the National Ocean Research Leadership Council to
submit a plan by June 30, 2003, to the Committees on
Appropriations. This plan will detail an implementation
strategy for the establishment of an integrated ocean and
coastal observing system. This plan shall, at a minimum: (1)
include an interagency governance structure; (2) define the
roles and responsibilities of each agency in implementing and
operating the system; (3) provide multi-year funding estimates
by agency; and (4) include a process for regional coordination
and technical support to ensure development of integrated
regional systems with a national observing initiative.
In addition, as development of an integrated long-term
Federal plan proceeds, the conferees urge NOAA to coordinate
existing or planned regional coastal observing systems,
particularly those for which funding has been provided or those
which use Federal platforms such as buoys. The conferees direct
NOAA to utilize the data management and technical expertise of
the Coastal Services Center to perform this function as well as
provide education and outreach to participating Federal
agencies, academic institutions, State agencies, and other
interests.
Ocean Health Initiative.--One area where coastal
observing systems would be useful is in exploring the
relationship between the oceans and human health. In 1999, a
National Research Council report, From Monsoons to Microbes:
Understanding the Ocean's Role in Human Health, focused
attention on the implications of ocean phenomena for human
health. The phenomena include climate change, weather events,
coastal hazards, infectious diseases, and harmful algal blooms.
As the nation faces increasing coastal pressures and scientists
identify changes in coastal systems, including sentinel species
such as dolphins and fish, NOAA is uniquely positioned to play
a strong role in identification, prediction, and prevention of
such changes. In addition, genetic and other characteristics of
marine organisms can be used for medical advances and NOAA can
help build a bridge between marine scientists and human health
experts.
The conferees direct the Under Secretary to establish an
Ocean Health Initiative to coordinate and focus agency
activities on critical areas of concern and identify critical
gaps in coverage. Of the amounts provided, $8,000,000 is for
critical research and projects aimed at closing identified
gaps. The conferees direct NOAA to: (1) work with the NSF and
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in
developing a joint program that builds on and complements
existing NOAA programs; (2) establish an external peer reviewed
grant process; and (3) provide for the selection and funding of
internationally recognized ``distinguished'' scholars to work
in collaboration with NOAA researchers. NOAA will submit a
spend plan for approval by the Committees on Appropriations
before program funding is obligated.
Coastal Ocean Program.--The conferees direct the program
to work with and continue its current levels of support for the
Baruch Institute's research and monitoring of small, high-
salinity estuaries and to continue its current levels of
support for the LUCES program. Within the funds provided for
the MERHL, the conferees direct NOAA to create a scientific and
professional position to act as senior scientist for NCCOS.
Aquatic Resources Initiative.--Of the amounts available
provided under this heading, up to $750,000 is for Bluegrass
Pride, Inc.
Coastal Zone Management.--A total of $75,144,000 is
provided to assist coastal states in implementing this program.
The Committee continues its' direction to report on the
measures of performance used to justify requesting funding for
this program. Bill language, carried in prior years, has been
modified.
Marine Sanctuary Program.--$34,750,000 is provided for
this program, of which $1,000,000 is from unobligated balances.
Under this heading, the recommendation includes $750,000 for
the activities of the Northwest Straits Citizens Advisory
Commission. This Commission was established to provide an
ecosystem focus on the marine resources in the area, mobilize
science and support marine resource committees, and establish a
forum for coordination and consensus building, in lieu of
Federal designation of the area as a Marine Sanctuary. The
conferees continue to believe that such a consensus-based
approach is an innovative and novel approach to promote marine
conservation, the goal of the Marine Sanctuary Program.
National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS).--The
conferees are aware that the National Centers for Coastal Ocean
Science (NCCOS) for several years have been cutting base funds
without Congressional approval from certain labs that received
specified program increases. The Conferees direct the NCCOS to
stop this practice immediately. Further the Conferees direct
NCCOS to report to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than April 15, 2003 on what purposes the funding from the
reductions was used and on the steps being taken to restore the
cuts to base that have been sustained by those labs.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
National Marine Fisheries Service
The conference agreement includes $580,066,000 in new
funding for the operations of the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS). In addition to this amount, $19,500,000 is
available from prior year unobligated balances for a total
operating level of $599,566,000.
Expand Stock Assessments.--The conferees have provided
$17,000,000 for additional stock assessments. Of the amounts
provided, $1,000,000 for implementation of a West Coast in-
season harvest data collection system.
Migratory Shark Fishery.--The conferees expect NMFS to
continue the funding for collaborative multi-regional
biological research on highly migratory species of sharks to
provide NMFS with the information necessary for effective
management of the highly migratory shark fishery and
conservation of imminently threatened shark fishery resources.
Cooperative Research.--In addition to the amounts shown
for the national cooperative research program, $1,700,000 is
available from unobligated prior year balances.
National Fisheries Information System.--Funding of
$2,600,000 is available from prior year unobligated balances.
Information Analysis and Dissemination.--The conferees
include $21,890,000 for this program, of which $400,000 is from
unobligated prior year balances.
California Sport fishing.--The conferees have been
advised that the Republic of Mexico has closed U.S. sport
fishing access to the Revillagigedo Islands. The sport fishing
industry provides $5.5 million in direct revenue to Southern
California and employs hundreds of people. The United States
and Mexico have maintained a cooperative working relationship
with regard to fishing and environmental issues, and U.S. boats
have had access to the Revillagigego Islands under permits
since 1994. The conferees direct the Secretary of Commerce to
investigate the reason of the withdrawal of these permits, and
to report to the Committee on Appropriations no later than
April 2003.
Northern Right Whale Preservation.--The conferees include
a total of $10,000,000 for North Atlantic right whale research,
management activities, and Atlantic coastal States'
implementation of cooperative Federal-state right whale
recovery plans, such as those concluded under section 6 of the
Endangered Species Act. Funding is included to assist NMFS and
its' partners to expedite right whale recovery in consultation
with the Implementation Team and the Take Reduction Team.
Of the amounts provided, $2,130,000 is for efforts to
reduce ship strikes, the leading cause of death of these
whales, including $200,000 for whale detection technologies,
$560,000 is for passive acoustic technologies, $295,000 is for
active acoustic technologies, and $200,000 is for measuring
whale response to approaching vessels; $2,060,000 is to reduce
entanglement including, $666,000 is for gear modification,
$200,000 is for Southeast disentanglement teams, $400,000 is
for the New England Aquarium efforts, and $800,000 is for the
Center for Coastal Studies. Of the funding provided for the
Center, final funding allocation should be based upon
recommendations of the right whale program coordinator.
Of the amounts provided for NMFS base programs, funding
is expected to support priority management, enforcement, and
ship strike prevention activities, including expedited
development and deployment of innovative fishing gear and whale
tracking technologies, improved stranding response and
procedures, a whale-sighting advisory system, and a mandatory
ship-reporting system. No more than 20 percent of funds
provided to NMFS may be used for salaries of existing
personnel.
Fisheries Research and Management.--The conferees include
$3,450,000 for the recreational fishing information network
program, and expect that the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf States
shall each receive one-third of these funds with funding for
inshore recreational species assessment and tagging efforts in
South Carolina.
In addition, the conferees expect that $500,000 will be
used to continue the effort to enhance the annual collection
and analysis of economic data on marine recreational fishing.
As in prior fiscal years, the conferees expect the
Oceanic Institute to administer funding for the Hawaii
Fisheries Development and for the Hawaii Stock Management Plan.
The conferees direct that $750,000 for the Interstate
Fish Commissions be equally divided among the three
commissions. The conferees also recommend that NMFS double its
effort with regard to California Cooperative Fisheries
Investigation cruises. Of the amounts recommended for the
Stellar Sea Lion Recovery Plan, $1,000,000 is for Alaska
Fisheries Foundation to study innovative methods to deter whale
predation of sea lions. In addition, the Committee expects NOAA
to continue its research initiative on Pacific decadal
oscillation, predator-prey relationships with particular
emphasis on killer whale predation on sea lion pups, and to
explore other factors in the marine environment that may be
contributing to the decline of Stellar sea lions and other
marine mammal populations.
Enforcement of International Dolphin Agreement.--Although
the National Marine Fisheries Service recently submitted it's
completed science report required by the International Dolphin
Conservation Program Act, the conference agreement includes
$2,700,000 for research on dolphin encirclement in the eastern
tropical Pacific (ETP). Funding is provided for additional
research on herd sizes on which sets are made, additional
biological sampling, impacts of cow-calf separation, and the
impacts on dolphin populations of vessels with a carrying
capacity of less than 400 short tons that are reportedly
setting on dolphins in the ETP.
The conferees are concerned that Mexico and other non-
U.S. parties to the International Dolphin Conservation Program
[IDCP], of which the United States is a member, are not fully
complying with the requirements of the IDCP, particularly with
respect to accurate reporting of dolphin interactions and
mortality. The conferees direct the Department, and in
consultation with key U.S. stakeholders, to evaluate and
document any lack of compliance by the non-U.S. parties to the
IDCP with its provisions, including through on-site visits and
discussions with government officials, observers and others
with first-hand knowledge of country practices, and to submit a
written report describing the findings to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than May 1, 2003. The report is
expected to include an evaluation of compliance with the on-
board observer program, with a focus on national observers;
reporting of dolphin interactions and mortality; international
requirements for vessels; and actions by parties to follow-up
on infractions identified by the international review panel.
Endangered Species--Columbia River.--The conferees
include $1,590,000 to purchase two mass marking trailers for
the state of Idaho.
Protected Resources Research and Management.--Of the
amounts provided for Native Marine Mammals, $100,000 is to
enable the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission to participate in
International Whaling Commission meetings.
Chesapeake Bay.--Of the amounts provided under this
heading, $500,000 is for sea grass restoration. In addition,
the conferees recommend that NOAA continue a micro-grant
program allowing local governments and non-profit organizations
to perform fisheries and shellfish restoration on the
Chesapeake Bay. In addition, $1,500,000 is for seven full-time
equivalents for the Oxford Laboratory to support the NOAA
Chesapeake Bay Office's fisheries, habitat restoration, and
ecosystem research needs.
The conferees provide $2,500,000 for a bay watersheds
education and training program to be administered by the
Chesapeake Bay Office. This initiative provides funding to
establish an office in Virginia to better focus NOAA resources
on Virginia issues in the Chesapeake Bay region. While
cooperation between Virginia and NOAA programs is good, and
significant NOAA funds are dispersed to Virginia programs, the
physical distance between Norfolk and Annapolis limits the
desired level of collaboration, not only with the NOAA
Chesapeake Bay Office but also the Chesapeake Bay Program along
with other signatories of the Chesapeake Bay agreement. This
initiative guides NOAA to integrate existing staff resources
across line offices and to appoint required staff to establish
the program, working in concert with pertinent existing local,
state, and federal offices or projects, academic institutions,
NGOs, and the public. The program should integrate existing
NOAA fisheries, habitat restoration, education, hazardous spill
response, coastal zone, coastal oceanography, and other
significant components. Of the amounts provided, $350,000 is
available for two full-time equivalents and administrative
costs, including office space.
Enforcement and Surveillance.--The conferees continue at
the fiscal year 2002 level funding for marine forensics and
southeast fisheries' law enforcement, and the conferees expect
cooperative laboratory activities to continue between NMFS and
State and local governments and the academic community. The
conferees recommend that three interstate marine fisheries
commissions may be eligible to receive a portion of the
Cooperative Enforcement Program funds for use in providing law
enforcement coordination among the States and NMFS.
The conferees provide $23,734,000 for the operations of
the enforcement and surveillance program, of which $14,800,000
is available from unobligated prior year balances. This is an
increase of $3,314,000 above the fiscal year 2002 level.
NMFS Facilities Maintenance.--Of the amounts provided,
$325,000 is for additional costs related to the Santa Cruz
laboratory.
Pacific Salmon Funding.--The conferees note the lack of
accountability and performance standards for resources
distributed to restore endangered and threatened salmon through
the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. The conferees have
provided hundreds of millions of dollars through this fund to
be distributed among certain States and tribes for habitat
restoration to assist in salmon population recovery. The
conferees understand that there are other habitat restoration
grant programs that fund grant proposals for the same purpose.
Given the austere operating climate the conferees are working
within, the conferees expect NOAA to prioritize funding from
other habitat restoration funds on non-salmon related
proposals.
The conferees understand the Secretary of Commerce has
substantial legal obligations under the Endangered Species Act
because no less than twenty-six runs of Pacific salmon are
listed as endangered. Failure to make progress toward recovery
under the Endangered Species Act poses adverse legal
consequences for the agency. The conferees have received no
assurances from the Administration that these funds have
actually contributed to the recovery of Pacific salmon
populations. This is particularly important at a time when the
Department is struggling to respond to a tremendous litigation
caseload.
The conferees understand that some mechanism is necessary
to assure legal and fiscal accountability for distribution of
funds to States with listed salmon species. In addition, the
conferees direct NOAA to provide an annual report to the
Committee no later than April 11, of each year on the projects
funded through the Pacific Salmon Recovery Fund and their
projected and actual results, particularly focusing on progress
toward recovery of endangered and threatened salmon species and
projected ending date for funding needs based on recovery
schedules. The conferees allow up to one percent of the amounts
made available for the grants to the states under the Pacific
Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund be made available to NOAA to
accomplish this task.
Saltonstall-Kennedy.--The conference agreement includes
$11,325,000 for the Saltonstall-Kennedy grant program,
including prior-year unobligated funds. The conferees
understand that NOAA has refocused the S-K program to address
the needs of fishing communities as defined by the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. The conferees understand that there is duplication
between this program and the priorities identified in the
accompanying NMFS table. Given the austere budget constraints
that conferees are operating within, the conferees expect NMFS
to award grants based on priorities and geographic areas that
are not specifically identified elsewhere in this agreement.
Therefore, the conferees expect NOAA to prioritize grant
proposals relating to fishing communities in non-specified
areas including, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of
the Marshall Islands, Republic of Palau, the Federated States
of Micronesia, and other similar areas. Grants should focus on
preventing over fishing, rebuilding of fisheries, and ensuring
conservation, while realizing the full potential of fishery
resources.
In addition, the conferees direct NOAA to assign high
priority to proposals for research and education efforts
directed at the protection of high-risk consumers from
naturally occurring bacteria associated with raw molluscan
shellfish, specifically Vibrio vulnificus. The conferees
strongly urge NOAA to provide no less than $250,000 to the Gulf
and Atlantic Foundation for their education efforts regarding
Vibrio vulnificus.
Louisiana Oyster Assistance.--The conferees include
$2,000,000 for economic assistance to the oyster fishery
affected by Hurricane Isidore, and Hurricane Lili. The
conferees direct that funding may be used only for activities
to rehabilitate oyster resources or oyster reefs damaged by the
storms and for domestic product marketing and seafood
promotion.

Oceanic and Atmospheric Research
The conference agreement includes $374,740,000 for the
Oceanic and Atmospheric Research line office. This amount
combined with $4,920,000 from prior year unobliged balances
provides a total program level of $379,660,000. The conference
agreement includes the following amounts for basic laboratory
research and support under Oceanic and Atmospheric Research:
Climate Change Research.--The conference agreement
includes a total of $166,315,000 for climate change research,
including $18,000,000 for the Climate Change Research
Initiative (CCRI), as proposed. This initiative provides
increases over the fiscal year 2002 level as follows:
$1,000,000 for the ocean observations/ocean systems; $3,000,000
for ARGO-related costs; $1,000,000 for regional assessments,
education, and outreach; $2,000,000 for research on the carbon
cycle; $5,000,000 for the climate modeling center; $4,000,000
for the global climate atmospheric observing system; and
$2,000,000 to study the aerosols/climate interaction.
Of the amounts provided, $67,608,000 is available for
competitively awarded grants, including grants to joint
institutes, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce. In
addition, $1,000,000 is provided to continue a certain program
in Arizona for regional climate change research.
Of the funding provided for climate and global change
activities, $12,000,000 shall only be available after the
Committees on Appropriation are provided with a plan for
completion of the national assessment required in section 106
of the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The plan should
include a completion date for the national assessment of no
later than September 30, 2004.
National Sea Grant Program.--The conference agreement
includes $62,410,000 for the Sea Grant program, of which
$2,000,000 is from prior year unobligated balances. The
conference agreement does not include a proposal to transfer
the program to the National Science Foundation. Instead, the
recommendation appropriates the same level of funding as in
fiscal year 2002 for the Sea Grant program, in accordance with
the National Sea Grant Act, Public Law 89-688, as amended.
Within the amounts provided, $3,000,000 is included for zebra
mussel research in accordance with the Non-indigenous Aquatic
Nuisance Prevention and Control Act; $3,000,000 is for oyster
disease research, including $1,000,000 to continue the Gulf of
Mexico initiative on oyster-related human health risks.
National Undersea Research Program (NURP).--A total of
$13,770,000 is included for the National Undersea Research
Program, of which $220,000 is from prior year unobligated
balances. The conferees direct that funding is to be equally
split between the east coast NURP centers and the west coast
NURP centers, including the Hawaiian and Pacific Center and the
West Coast and Polar Regions Center. The conferees expect level
funding will be available for Aquarius, ALVIN, and program
administration.
NISA Alaska.--The conferees include $1,500,000 to address
the proliferation of exotic species such as Atlantic salmon in
the marine environment in the North Pacific. Of this amount,
$750,000 is for the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission
to prevent the escapement of Atlantic salmon into Alaska
streams and to address other invasive species issues including
mitten crab and green crab.
NISA/Ballast Water Demonstrations.--The conference
agreement includes $2,250,000 for this program, of which
$1,900,000 is from unobligated balances. The conferees expect
special attention should be given to the concerns of the
Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
The conference agreement includes total of $698,767,000
for the operations of the National Weather Service (NWS) for
fiscal year 2003.
Local Warnings and Forecasts--The conferees provide
$555,178,000 for local warnings and forecasts. Within the
amounts provided, $2,500,000 is to begin a new seven-year
initiative to improve the accuracy and timeliness of aviation
warnings and forecasts.
Of the amounts provided, the conferees direct the NWS to
continue the Susquehanna River Basin gauges project and expand
this program to include the Delaware River Basin.
The conferees have provided sufficient funding to
continue operations of the Huntsville, Alabama center.
Air Quality Initiative--The conference agreement includes
$3,000,000 to complete the analysis of the air quality pilot
program, finalize a concept of operations, and begin
procurement of the information technology infrastructure
necessary to support operational air quality forecasts by the
end of fiscal year 2004. In addition, $3,000,000 is provided to
complete the operational implementation of a temperature
forecasting pilot in New England. Funding should provide for
the modernization 200 meteorological observing stations and for
the operational use of high-resolution forecasts models at 8
sites in fiscal year 2003.
Flash floods.--The conferees direct NOAA to commission
the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to assess
the availability, performance, and capability of the NWS NEXRAD
located on Sulphur Mountain in Ventura County, California to
detect heavy precipitation and aid forecasters at the Los
Angeles Weather Forecast Office in providing flash flood
warnings and forecasts, and on the basis of that study, to
provide the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
Atmosphere with a report on the performance of that mission by
the NWS. The report also should include any recommendations for
improving the accuracy and timeliness of flash flood warnings
in and around western Los Angeles and Ventura Counties,
California.
Systems Operations & Maintenance--The conference
agreement includes $87,146,000 for systems operations and
maintenance.
In addition, the conferees continue direction from prior
years regarding Erie, Pennsylvania and Williston, North Dakota.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICE
The conference agreement includes $150,616,000 for the
operational and research and development programs of the
National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
(NESDIS).
Environmental Satellite Observing Systems--The Committee
recommendation has provided a total of $86,168,000 for this
account, including $23,771,000 for product processing and
distribution. Within the recommendation, $1,500,000 is included
for the Joint Center, and $4,000,000 is for a global wind
demonstration.
Data Centers and Information Services--The conference
agreement includes $64,448,000 for NOAA's Data Centers and
Information Services, including $15,850,000 for the climate
database modernization efforts in Kentucky and West Virginia.
The conferees restore funding for the regional climate centers,
which was proposed for elimination. The conferees recognize the
value of NOAA climate data centers as the U.S. repository for
historical environmental data.
The conferees direct NESDIS to continue fiscal year 2002
current staffing levels at the Gilmore Creek Tracking Station
in fiscal year 2003. NESDIS will provide a report to the
Committees on Appropriations by March 1, 2003 on how it plans
to implement the new National Polar Orbiting Environmental
Satellite System and its plans for the Gilmore Creek Tracking
Station including staffing projections.
Within the amounts provided, $300,000 is to conduct a
study to assess the feasibility, costs, and timing issues of
the Fairmont, West Virginia location as a third site for
physical storage of data from the CLASS program.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
PROGRAM SUPPORT
The conference agreement includes $173,397,000 for the
Program Support line office. The conference agreement continues
a limitation of the administrative costs of the agency to
$243,000,000. This limitation is in response to NOAA's practice
of assessing certain programs and activities for the costs of
managing those programs, including grant programs.
The recommendation includes $91,349,000 for maritime and
aviation fleet maintenance and operations. The recommendation
provides sufficient funding for routine maintenance of the
existing NOAA fleet.
Program Review.--The conferees laud the results of the
Program Review Task Force (PRT) review. In fact, a number of
the task forces' recommendations address longstanding concerns
regarding the management of NOAA. For example, the grant
process has been of particular interest to the conferees. Many
of the conferees have heard complaints from grant recipients
regarding unnecessary delays. For fiscal year 2002 alone, these
delays contributed to $462,566,000 in prior year funding
remaining unspent. In a number of areas, the conferees have
taken into account these unobligated balances when determining
the fiscal year 2003 levels for certain programs. The conferees
support the efforts of NOAA management to alleviate many of
these problems.
Office Relocations.--The conferees direct the Department
to submit quarterly reports providing details of all office
moves, openings, reductions and closings, which will be
considered as a reprogramming under section 605 of the Act. The
conferees expect to be notified of office relocations before
final agreements are made.
Pribilof Island Cleanup.--The recommendation includes
$8,000,000 for Pribilof Island cleanup. In 2000, Congress
passed the Pribilof Islands Transition Act which created the
framework under which NOAA was to complete the environmental
cleanup of the property that it currently or formerly owned on
the islands, and complete the transfer of that property to the
designated local entities. Concern has been raised regarding
the lack of a comprehensive cleanup plan, and firm cost
estimates. The conferees direct NOAA to provide timetable and
cost estimates to complete a cleanup and land transfer no later
than April 11, 2003.
Minority Serving Institutions.--The conferees direct that
this program be extended to Native Hawaiian Serving
Institutions and Alaskan Native Serving Institutions as defined
in the Higher Education Act.
Facilities.--The conference agreement includes $1,000,000
for necessary improvements to the National Aquarium. The
conferees expect the Department of Commerce to prepare a 20-
year plan to upgrade the facility. The conferees expect a plan
to be provided to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than July 1, 2003.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Procurement, Acquisition and Construction
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
The recommendation includes a programmatic level of
$832,230,000 for fiscal year 2003, of which $762,230,000 is
from new appropriations and $70,000,000 is from prior year
unobligated balances. The recommendation assumes $3,200,000
from prior year deobligations. This account funds capital
assets acquisition activities, including system and land
acquisition, marine sanctuary and estuarine reserve
construction, aircraft and vessel systems, and equipment.
The conferees have amended section 204 regarding
reprogramming requirements to include all increases and
decreases affecting capital assets. The following distribution
reflects the activities funded within this account:
Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELP)--
The conferees include $37,667,000 for the land acquisition
program. The conferees understand that regulations for this
program have not yet been finalized. For the priorities
identified by the conferees, the interim regulations will apply
as in fiscal year 2002, including funding and match
requirements. This program is intended to protect those coastal
and estuarine areas with significant conservation, recreation,
ecological, historical, or aesthetic value.
Marine Sanctuaries Construction.--Of the amounts
provided, $5,000,000 is for the final Federal costs of the
efforts relating to the National Monitor sanctuary center.
National Marine Fisheries Service.--The conferees
continue the aquatic resource program at the level of
$7,000,000.
Construction.--The conferees remain concerned that there
is no long-term facility plan, including maintenance schedule
for NOAA. A five-year plan for such purposes was requested
during the fiscal year 2003 budget hearing before the House. To
date, no plan has been provided. Further, there have been two
separate incidents where NOAA has changed the scope of a funded
project, including the location, without prior notification to
the Committees on Appropriations. The conferees expect a final
plan no later than June 30, 2003.
Geostationary Systems.--Under this heading, the conferees
include $221,391,000, as requested, of which $50,000,000 is to
be derived from unobligated prior year balances. The conferees
understand that the launch readiness date for N, O, and P, has
slipped by one year. In addition, the conferees understand that
the earliest available launch date for the GOES-R series has
been revised from 2010 to 2012. The most recent data available
to the conferees reflect a total $55,400,000 available from
unobligated prior year balances to be used in fiscal year 2003
therefore, $5,400,000 continues to be available for any
unforeseen purposes.
Polar Orbiting Systems.--Under this heading, the
conferees include $347,538,000, as requested, of which
$25,000,000 is to be derived from unobligated prior year
balances. The conferees understand that NOAA expects a ten-
month delay in launching NOAA-M as a result of the
unavailability of a launch pad site.
The National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental
Satellite System (NPOESS) is a joint program equally funded by
the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense based
upon a 1994 decision to integrate civil and military polar-
orbiting meteorological satellites systems into a single
national system. This decision created a 50/50 cost-sharing
partnership between the two departments. Due to the concern
raised by NPOESS program managers, the conference agreement
continues language formalizing this cost-sharing partnership as
in the fiscal year 2002. The conferees are aware that NOAA did
not obligate $10,200,000 of the amounts provided in fiscal year
2002 for NPOESS as a result of Department of Defense obligation
decisions in fiscal year 2002.
Fleet Replacement.--The conference agreement includes
$50,874,000 for the second fisheries vessel. This vessel would
replace the 40-year-old ALBATROS IV, as proposed. In addition,
$9,000,000 is provided to continue construction of small
waterplane area twin hull vessel to be homeported in New
Castle, New Hampshire.
Hurricane Surveillance Aircraft.--The conference
agreement includes $8,400,000 for necessary instrumentation
upgrades to the Gulfstream IV to improve storm-tracking
forecasts, as proposed.
PACIFIC COASTAL SALMON RECOVERY
The conference agreement includes $130,000,000 under this
heading. A total of $40,000,000 is provided to fulfill the
obligation of the United States under the 1999 Pacific Salmon
Treaty between the United States and Canada. Specifically,
$25,000,000 is included to complete the capitalization of the
Northern Boundary Fund, and $15,000,000 is included to complete
the capitalization of the Southern Boundary Fund. In addition,
$90,000,000 is provided for grants to California, Oregon,
Washington, Alaska, and coastal and river tribes for habitat
restoration.
Of the amounts provided for the states, $28,000,000 is
for the State of Washington, $22,000,000 is for the State of
Alaska, $14,000,000 is for the State of Oregon, $14,000,000 is
for the State of California, $9,000,000 is for the Pacific
Coastal tribes, and $3,000,000 is for the Columbia River
tribes.
Of the funds provided for the State of Alaska, $5,000,000
is for the Arctic Yukon-Kushokwim Sustainable Salmon
initiative, $1,000,000 is for construction of salmon mitigation
passes, $1,000,000 is for the Cook Inlet Fishing Community
Assistance Program, $500,000 is for the Yukon River Drainage
Association, $500,000 is for Fort Richardson fisheries,
$500,000 is for Elmendorf AFB hatcheries, $500,000 is for Fort
Wainwright fisheries, $450,000 is for universal quality
standards, $450,000 is for competitive analysis of global
salmon, $250,000 is to restore the king salmon runs in Coffman
Cove, $250,000 is to enable the State of Alaska to participate
in discussions regarding Columbia River hydro system
management, $2,000,000 is to restore salmon runs at Chester
Creek, Ship Creek, and Campbell Creek in Anchorage, $1,000,000
is to restore salmon runs in Seward, Alaska, and $100,000 is
for the United Fishermen of Alaska's subsistence program.
Of the funds provided for the State of Washington,
$4,000,000 is for the Washington State Department of Natural
Resources and other State and Federal agencies for purposes of
implementing the State of Washington's Forest and Fish Report.
The funding shall be spent in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Forest and Fish Report and consistent with
the requirements of the Endangered Species and Clean Water
Acts. Further, $1,590,000 is for the purchase of two new mass
marking trailers.
Of the funds provided to the State of Oregon, $1,100,000
is for conservation mass marking at the Columbia River
Hatcheries; and $2,185,000 is for the purchase of two new and
one used mass marking trailers.
Bill language is included designating the entire amount
under the conservation category.
Fishermen's Contingency Fund
The conference agreement includes a total program level
of $2,376,000, of which $2,375,000 is from unobligated prior
year funds.
The Fishermen's Contingency Fund provides compensation to
U.S. fishermen for damage or loss of fishing gear and any
resulting loss because of natural or man-made obstructions
related to oil and gas exploration, development, and production
on the Outer Continental Shelf.
FOREIGN FISHING OBSERVER FUND
The conference agreement includes $1,833,000 under this
heading, of which $1,832,000 is from unobligated prior year
funds.
Fees paid into the Fund are collected from owners and
operators of certain foreign fishing vessels that fish within
the United States Fishery Conservation Zone and are intended to
be used by the Secretary of Commerce to finance the cost of
placing United States observers aboard such fishing vessels.
FISHERIES FINANCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conferees note that an appropriation is not necessary
for the fisheries finance program account. Of the loan
authority provided through bill language, $5,000,000 is for
entry level and small vessel individual fishery quota [IFQ]
obligation guarantees in the halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska pursuant to section 1104A(a)(7) of the Merchant
Marine Act of 1936. These funds are provided for IFQ loans in
accordance with section 303(d)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act
and section 108(g) of the Sustainable Fisheries Act.
In addition, $59,000,000 is for Traditional direct loan
authority, of which $40,000,000 may be used for the direct
loans to the United States distant water tuna fleet.
Departmental Management
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $44,954,000 for costs
of managing the Department of Commerce. The recommendation
includes $4,776,000 for the recurring costs for guard
contracts, security equipment upgrades and an emergency
communication system for the Herbert Clark Hoover Building
originally funded with fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental
appropriations; $1,590,000 is for IT security increases; and
$1,200,000 is for continuity of operation efforts.
Telework Programs.--The conference agreement includes
language, under section 208 to allow the Department of Commerce
to carryover unused funds into the next fiscal year, saved as a
consequence of the Department's implementation of telecommuting
programs. Telecommuting programs offer the opportunity for
cost-savings as well as increased productivity and employee
morale. By allowing the Department to keep the savings from
telecommuting, there should be a strong incentive for the
Department to increase its number of telecommuters, as required
by section 359 of Public Law 106-346. Telecommuting also can
help improve traffic congestion, provide energy savings and
improve air quality.
This appropriation provides for the Office of the
Secretary and for staff offices of the Department, which assist
in the formulation of policy, management, and administration.
Office Relocations.--The conference agreement continues
to direct the Department to submit quarterly reports providing
details of all office moves, opening, reductions and closing,
which will be considered as a reprogramming under section 605
of the Act.
Office of Inspector General
The conference agreement includes $20,635,000 for the
Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General for fiscal
year 2003.
General Provisions--Department of Commerce
The conference agreement includes the following General
Provisions for the Department of Commerce:
Section 201.--The conference agreement includes section
201, included in both the House and Senate, regarding
certification of advanced payments.
Section 202.--The conference agreement includes section
202, included in both the House and Senate, allowing funds for
hire of passenger motor vehicles, and for services, uniforms
and allowances as authorized by law.
Section 203.--The conference agreement includes section
203, included in both the House and Senate, making permanent a
provision prohibiting of funds to be used to support hurricane
reconnaissance aircraft and activities that are under the
control of the United States Air Force or the United States Air
Force Reserve. The House section did not propose to make this
section permanent.
Section 204.--The conference agreement includes section
204, included in both the House and Senate, regarding transfer
authority among Commerce Department appropriation accounts. The
language also makes the transfers subject to the Committee's
standard reprogramming procedures, including the acquisition
and disposal of capital assets. The Senate did not contain a
provision on the matter of capital assets.
Section 205.--The conference agreement includes section
205, included in the House, requiring that any costs incurred
by the Department in response to funding reductions shall be
absorbed within the total budgetary resources available to the
Department and shall not be subject to the reprogramming
limitations in this Act. The Senate did not contain a similar
provision.
Section 206.--The conference agreement includes section
206, included in both the House and Senate, making permanent a
provision to allow the Secretary to award contracts for certain
mapping and charting activities in accordance with the Federal
Property and Administrative Services Act. The House did not
make the provision permanent.
Section 207.--The conference agreement includes section
207, included in both the House and Senate, allowing the

$28,260,000 within the ``National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Construction of Research Facilities'' account, for
five projects. The House did not contain a similar provision.
Section 209.--The conference agreement includes section
209, included in the Senate, to provide $10,000,000 for an
Alaskan Seafood marketing program. The House did not contain a
similar provision.
Section 210.--The conference agreement includes section
210, included in the Senate, to authorize and appropriate
$50,000,000 for travel and tourism grant program. The House did
not include a similar provision.

engage in a certain lease arrangement to be funded from base
resources.
Section 214.--The conference agreement includes section
214, a new provision, designating certain programs under the
conservation category.
TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY
The conferees do not agree with the practice of the
Judiciary of displaying significant program increases as
adjustments to base. The conferees direct the Judiciary to
discontinue this practice.
The conferees expect the Judiciary to submit a financial
plan, allocating all sources of available funds including
appropriations, fee collections, and carryover balances. The
Judiciary should consider this financial plan to be the
baseline for reprogramming and expects the plan to be submitted
within 30 days after enactment of this Act.
Supreme Court of the United States
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $45,743,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Supreme Court, as provided by the
House, instead of $44,399,000 as provided by the Senate. The
conference agreement provides increases for information
technology and security related initiatives.
The conferees are aware of continued concerns about the
number of minority law clerks at the Supreme Court. The
Conferees are appreciative of the Court's responsiveness in
providing information regarding its hiring practices and
encourages the Court and the Judicial Conference of the United
States to continue to make progress in this matter.
CARE OF THE BUILDING AND GROUNDS
The conference agreement includes $41,626,000 for the
Supreme Court ``Care of the Building and Grounds'' account, as
provided by the House, instead of $53,304,000 as provided by
the Senate. The conference agreement is $12,000,000 below the
request for the Supreme Court building renovation project. The
conferees understand that these additional obligations will
occur in subsequent fiscal years and therefore may be budgeted
in those fiscal years.
The conferees recognize there are security concerns
related to the building modernization project and the Architect
of the Capitol is directed to ensure that the Court's security
concerns are addressed throughout the procurement and
construction of the project. The conferees direct the Architect
of the Capitol to submit the Committees on Appropriations, no
later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, a financial
plan and schedule for this project.
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $20,313,000 for the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, instead
of $20,490,000 as provided by the House and $20,136,000 as
provided by the Senate.
The conferees recognize that the Court has additional
information technology and facility renovation requirements.
However, the conferees also understand that between March 1992
and March 2001, filings have decreased by 13 percent. The
conferees recommend the Court examine its base operating budget
to identify funding that could be used to meet the Court's
remaining information technology and facilities requirements.
No funding is provided to establish a deputy circuit executive
position.
United States Court of International Trade
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $13,687,000 for the
U.S. Court of International Trade, as provided by the House,
instead of $13,529,000 as provided by the Senate. The conferees
are pleased with the Court's utilization of the Judiciary
Information Technology Fund to upgrade and enhance the Court's
use of information technology without requiring additional
appropriations.
Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $3,800,000,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Courts of Appeals, District Courts
and Other Judicial Services. Within the funding provided, the
Conferees direct not less than $10,000,000 for facilities
enhancements to meet requirements associated with high threat
trials and to upgrade the Judiciary's mail handling operations.
VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION TRUST FUND
The conference agreement provides $2,784,000 from the
Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund as provided by both the
House and the Senate.
DEFENDER SERVICES
The conference agreement includes $538,461,000 for the
Federal Judiciary's Defender Services account, instead of
$545,129,000 as provided by the House and $531,792,000 as
provided by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes an increase of
$30,066,000 to annualize the panel attorney rate increase
provided in fiscal year 2002. This increase brought panel
attorney hourly rates up to $90 for in-court and out-of-court
hours. This was the first significant increase in private panel
attorney hourly rates since 1986 and represents a 20 percent
increase in the in-court rate and a 64 percent increase in the
out-of-court rate.
In fiscal year 2003, the Judicial Conference requested an
increase in the panel attorney rate to $113 per hour, which if
approved would amount to a 25 percent increase over the rate
approved in fiscal year 2002. Because it was recently
implemented, the Judicial Conference is unable to document the
impact of the significant increase provided in fiscal year 2002
to determine if that rate is sufficient to solve the problem of
obtaining adequate counsel for CJA representations. In
addition, from 1987 to 2001, the Congress and the Judicial
Conference provided a higher hourly rate in 16 districts than
the standard rate provided in the other 78 lower-cost
districts. The conferees understand that there continues to be
disparities throughout the country in the costs to provide
legal representation, and yet the Judicial Conference's
requested $113 hourly rate would reimburse panel attorneys at
the same rate nationally.
Because of these uncertainties between localities, the
size of the increase approved in fiscal year 2002, and the
level of funding required to annualize this increase in fiscal
year 2003, the conference agreement does not include the
requested additional increase in the hourly rate this fiscal
year. The conferees expect the Judicial Conference, before
requesting any future rate increases, to consider the concerns
described above. The conferees also expect any future rate
increases requested above inflation to be justified as a
program increase.
FEES OF JURORS AND COMMISSIONERS
The conference agreement includes $54,636,000 for Fees of
Jurors and Commissioners, as provided by the House and Senate.
COURT SECURITY
The conference agreement includes $268,400,000 for the
Federal Judiciary's Court Security Account, instead of
$286,200,000 as provided by the House and $276,342,000 as
provided by the Senate. In addition, the conference agreement
includes $15,800,000 in the U.S. Marshals Service, Salaries and
Expenses account for supervisory deputy marshals previously
funded in this account.
In order to address the courts' security requirements,
funding for this program has increased by approximately 50
percent since fiscal year 2001. However, the conferees are
concerned that as the program has grown, sufficient attention
has not been provided to program and budget administration,
especially oversight of court security officer funding,
positions and full-time equivalents. The conferees expect that
the funding provided in the conference agreement will
significantly improve this deficiency.
The conferees understand that this is a unique account
appropriated to the Judiciary but primarily managed by the
Department of Justice. The Committee expects the Director of
the U.S. Marshals Service to provide the same level of
budgetary and program oversight to this program as programs
appropriated directly to the U.S. Marshals Service.
Within the level of funding provided, the conferees
direct U.S. Marshals Service to conduct a study with an
independent consultant on the management of this program and
the unique relationship between the Federal Judiciary, the U.S.
Marshals Service, and the Federal Protective Service in
administering this program and providing facilities security
for the Judiciary.
The conferees expect future budget justifications to
clearly display the level and types of court security equipment
and systems requested compared to the current year.
Within the level of funding provided, $1,000,000 shall be
transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service for a courthouse
security survey to be conducted by the Judicial Security
Divison/Judicial Security Systems personnel.
Following the September 11th and anthrax attacks, the
Judiciary was directed in the Conference Report accompanying
Public Law 107-117, to consider establishing a court operations
support center located outside of Washington, D.C. The
Judiciary's study, conducted by an independent expert and
endorsed by the Judicial Conference, recommends establishing a
small leased facility at least 20 miles outside of Washington,
D.C. This facility would help ensure continuity of operations
in the event that administrative and automation support
functions are shut down as a result of the closure of the
Thurgood Marshal Federal Judiciary Building (TMFJB). The
Judiciary's study recommends transferring portions of the
courts' payroll processing, financial disbursing, and
information technology support to this new facility. The study
also recommends that this facility be within a reasonable
travel range of the TMFJB so that it can be utilized by
essential Administrative Office and court staff in the event
that certain facilities located in Washington D.C. are shut
down. The conferees direct the Judiciary to establish a
judiciary automation and communications operations facility
consistent with its study at an economically feasible location.
The conferees expect costs of this facility to be absorbed
within existing available resources as proposed by the
Judiciary. The conferees encourage the Judiciary to find
alternative uses for the facility during non-emergency periods.
However, the primary design goal of the facility should be
continuity of operations. As recommended in the study, the
conferees direct the Judiciary to provide telework
opportunities at this facility.
As discussed in the beginning of Title III, a financial
plan is required to be submitted for this program.
Administrative Office of the United States Courts
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $63,500,000 for the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
Federal Judicial Center
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $20,856,000 for
salaries and expenses of the Federal Judicial Center as
provided by the House, instead of $20,156,000 as provided by
the Senate.
Judicial Retirement Funds
PAYMENT TO JUDIDICARY TRUST FUNDS
The conference agreement includes $35,300,000 for payment
to various judicial retirement funds, as provided by both the
House and Senate.
United States Sentencing Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $12,090,000 for the
U.S. Sentencing Commission, instead of $12,344,000 as provided
by the House and $11,835,000 as provided by the Senate. As part
of the financial plan discussed at the beginning of this title,
the Commission is directed to provide plan for the utilization
of carryover balances.
General Provisions--The Judiciary
Section 301.--The conference agreement includes a
provision included by both the House and Senate allowing
appropriations to be used for services as authorized by 5
U.S.C. 3109.
Section 302.--The conference agreement includes a
provision included in the House related to the transfer of
funds. The Senate included a similar provision.
Section 303.--The conference agreement includes a
provision included in by the House allowing up to $11,000 of
salaries and expenses provided in this title to be used for
official representation expenses of the Judicial Conference of
the United States. The Senate included a similar provision.
TITLE IV--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCY
In total, the conference agreement includes
$7,900,660,000 for the Department of State and the Broadcasting
Board of Governors. Of the total amount provided,
$7,762,460,000 is derived from general purpose discretionary
funds and $138,200,000 is scored as mandatory spending. This
funding level includes significant program increases to improve
diplomatic readiness and security. The conference agreement
includes the full amount requested, $1,308,000,000, to continue
worldwide security activities, including the design and
construction of replacement facilities for the most vulnerable
overseas posts.
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
The conference agreement for the Department of State is
intended to continue the Department's efforts to achieve
diplomatic readiness, strengthen diplomatic and border
security, and to institute sweeping management reforms. In
fiscal year 2002, the Congress enacted an appropriations
increase of 16.8 percent to the Department's operating budget,
including funding to support the hiring and training of an
additional 910 employees.
The conference agreement includes a total of
$7,394,026,000 for fiscal year 2003 for the Department of
State. Of the total amount provided, $7,255,826,000 is derived
from general purpose discretionary funds and $138,200,000 is
scored as mandatory spending. The overall funding level for
fiscal year 2003 represents an additional 8.6 percent increase
to the operating budget, which will support up to 585
additional new positions. The conferees expect that this
funding level will allow the Department to meet critical
embassy security and staffing requirements, modernize its
technology and equipment, and continue vigorous management
reform initiatives to right-size America's overseas presence.
The conference agreement includes a total of
$5,587,293,000 for the discretionary appropriation accounts
under Administration of Foreign Affairs; $1,539,710,000 for
International Organizations and Conferences; $57,504,000 for
International Commissions; and $71,319,000 for Other
activities. The conferees' priorities for the Department of
State are delineated in the following paragraphs.
Administration of Foreign Affairs
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS
The conference agreement includes $3,822,258,000 for the
Diplomatic and Consular Programs account, including
$553,000,000 to continue funding for worldwide security
upgrades and $292,693,000 for public diplomacy programs. The
conference agreement represents an increase of $192,246,000
above the fiscal year 2002 appropriation. Within this total,
the funding level for worldwide security upgrades is
$65,265,000 above the fiscal year 2002 level and the same
amount as requested.
This appropriation provides for the formulation and
execution of United States foreign policy, including the
conduct of diplomatic and consular relations with foreign
countries, diplomatic relations with international
organizations, and related activities. The account includes
funding for all of the program and operations bureaus and
offices of the Department of State and the Foreign Service.
The conference agreement includes funding for program
activities described below:
Diplomatic Readiness Initiatives.--The conference
agreement includes a program increase of $70,000,000 for the
diplomatic readiness initiative to support the hiring and
training of approximately 399 new foreign service and civil
service employees. Before obligation of these funds the
Department shall provide the Committees, through the regular
reprogramming process, a comprehensive spending and staffing
plan accompanied by materials demonstrating any and all right-
sizing analyses and actions taken worldwide since the issuance
of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel report in 1999. The
Department may propose, through the reprogramming process, to
reallocate funding under the diplomatic readiness initiative
for critical foreign national hiring needs. The conferees
expect that the highest priority will be placed on new
positions in Near East and South Asia. The program increase
described below for public diplomacy includes funding for
additional foreign national public diplomacy staffing overseas.
Public Diplomacy Programs.--The conference agreement
includes language specifying that $292,693,000 is available
only for Public Diplomacy programs. The integration of the
United States Information Agency into the State Department in
fiscal year 2000 resulted in public diplomacy resources being
spread across several different bureaus. The conferees believe
that separately identifying total resource levels will
facilitate the Committees' ability to monitor funding levels
and trends for these activities. The amount identified for
public diplomacy programs includes the costs of personnel and
programs throughout theDepartment. The conferees expect the
Department to identify all organizational impediments to optimal
performance of public diplomacy programs, and propose the necessary
changes through the reprogramming process.
The conference agreement includes a program increase of
$10,300,000 for public diplomacy programs. This funding will
support expansion of InfoUSA content, and other internet-based
information programs, including the translation of content into
Arabic and South Asian languages, as well as the continuation
of programs in the Arab and Muslim world initiated with fiscal
year 2002 supplemental funding. This funding will also support
surveys and research to improve effectiveness of public
diplomacy programs, and increased local staffing worldwide.
The conferees acknowledge the critical role that public
diplomacy will play in the global war against terror. The
Department will not be successful in its important public
diplomacy mission unless it is guided by a comprehensive,
sustained strategy for program execution. The Department is
directed to submit a Public Diplomacy Strategy to the
Committees on Appropriations no later than June 1, 2003. The
conferees understand that the need for interagency coordination
in international public information programs has resulted in
the creation of the White House Office of Global
Communications. The use of any funds provided to the Department
of State under this Act or any prior Act for initiatives or
programs of the Office of Global Communications must be
approved in advance by the Committees on Appropriations.
Africa Policy Advisory Panel.--The conference agreement
includes language authorizing the Secretary to create an Africa
Policy Advisory Panel, and provides up to $500,000 to fund
related costs. The conferees expect that this panel will be
appointed by the Secretary and will deliver its final report to
the Secretary no later than one year from the enactment of this
Act. The conferees believe that the U.S. Government too
frequently fails to devote sufficient attention and resources
to African affairs. African nations today face enormous
obstacles to development and political stability. The United
States has a vital national interest in helping African nations
to develop workable solutions to provide people with freedom,
economic opportunity, and functioning governments.
The conferees expect that the establishment of this panel
will generate greater interest in the importance of Sub-Saharan
Africa. In calling for this panel, the conferees recognize the
complex issues facing Africa and the limited budgetary
resources available to help policymakers address these
problems.
The conferees acknowledge the Department's increased
efforts in these areas, including the strengthening of the
trading relationships spawned by the African Growth and Trade
Act, substantially increasing two-way trade with Africa,
launching a Sovereign Credit Rating Initiative, increased HIV/
AIDS funding, programs to enhance African peacekeeping
capabilities, support for UN and regional peacekeeping efforts,
and assistance in ending conflicts continent-wide, including in
the Sudan and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Assertive engagement between Africa and the United States
is vital to U.S. interest and necessary. Africa is a key player
in our global war against international terrorism. Africa is
also a key supplier of crucial resources, including oil. The
most serious challenge facing Africa today is the AIDS
pandemic: its social, economic, and political impact will be
devastating for millions of Africans for years to come. In the
past decade alone an estimated 17 million Africans died of
AIDS. Of the 40 million people infected with HIV worldwide, an
estimated 28 million are in sub-Saharan Africa. Civil war
continues to plague the continent. The conflict in Sudan
continues unabated with two million killed and four million
displaced.
It is critically important to strengthen our relations
with Africa and formulate a coherent, effective Africa policy.
An Africa Policy Advisory Panel could help meet these
objectives and explore related issues, including how the United
States can most effectively assist in the fight against AIDS/
HIV and other infectious deadly diseases in Africa; what role
the United States should play in conflict prevention and
resolution in Africa; how the United States can use its
economic and development assistance more effectively; how the
United States should approach recurring natural and man-made
humanitarian crisis; what specific measures the United States
can take to promote democracy, human rights, religious
tolerance, and a free press in Africa; how the United States
can help strengthen Africa's institutional capacity to fight
international terrorism effectively, and U.S.-Africa security
relations; what specific measures the United States can take to
increase trade and investment between Africa and the United
States.
The conferees expect that this panel will take a fresh
look at U.S. policy in the region, focus more attention to the
importance of U.S.-African affairs, and make recommendations to
the Secretary for specific action.
Trafficking in Persons.--The conferees continue to be
concerned about the serious problem of international
trafficking in persons. The conferees note the important role
given to the Department to monitor and combat trafficking in
persons in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection
Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386), and the establishment of the
Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP
Office) within the Department. The conference agreement
includes the costs to continue the operations of this office.
The conferees believe that there must be increased
coordination among executive branch agencies and even within
the Department of State with respect to the implementation of
the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-
386). While the Committee recognizes that efforts have been
made by the Interagency Task Force to establish a lower level
group of the Senior Policy Advisers' Group, chaired by the
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, the Department
needs to better coordinate day-to-day activities to implement
the Act. Current efforts by the Office to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking to fulfill a similar function are impeded by the
inability to obtain full participation and cooperation from
other agencies and offices involved in addressing this critical
area. In particular, the Committee is concerned that at times
there is unnecessary duplication among the agencies that
implement the program and inconsistent or uncoordinated
approaches to combating the heinous abuses inherent in
trafficking in persons.
In order to improve accountability for government-wide
anti-trafficking policies, the conference agreement includes
language establishing a Senior Policy Operating Group, chaired
by the Director of the Office to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking, who will have enhanced responsibility to help
coordinate these programs. It will also provide the Committees
and others in Congress a central point to obtain information
and affect anti-trafficking programs administered by the U.S.
Government. The conferees also expect that such a group will
ensure that scarce resources are wisely used. The conferees
believe that U.S. Government anti-trafficking programs should
deliver coordinated, effective assistance to address all three
areas of prevention, protection and prosecution, and such
programs should focus on both sex trafficking and trafficking
involving labor slavery, just as the Act addresses all such
trafficking abuses.
The conferees do not intend to transfer ultimate agency
decision-making power to the Operating Group. Its establishment
is intended, however, to ensure active interagency discussion
and full interagency coordination before and after agency
decisions are made regarding significant actions to combat
trafficking and to implement the Trafficking Victims Protection
Act of 2000. Where grants are awarded by an agency's field
offices abroad, the Operating Group will have to work out a
mechanism to ensure that the making of such grants is not
impeded while ensuring coordination between the agencies
involved and the Operating Group.
Within the amount provided under this heading, the
conferees expect the Department to provide sufficient staff
positions from within Global Affairs to the TIP Office to
assist in the production of the Department's annual report on
trafficking in persons. In addition, the recommendation
includes an increase of $500,000 for grants to the
participating organizations in the War Against Trafficking
Alliance for activities and services related to preparation,
execution and follow-up for an international conference on sex
trafficking to be held in Washington, DC. This conference will
bring additional international attention to the issues related
to sex trafficking, and will be an opportunity to network,
share best practices, and develop international plans of action
on prevention, prosecution and protection.
Facilities.--The conference agreement includes
$30,448,000 for facilities-related initiatives. This includes
$14,000,000 for the relocation and housing of the staff of the
United States Mission to the United Nations in temporary space
in anticipation of the construction of a new headquarters
building. The funding level also includes an increase of
$16,448,000, and a total funding level of $31,305,000, to
continue the renovation and expansion of the Charleston
Financial Services Complex and to cover consolidation costs for
functions moving from Washington and the Financial Services
Center in Bangkok.
Availability of Reports.--The conferees recommend that
each U.S. Embassy translate into the official language of the
host country the report for the host country from the ``Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices'', the ``Annual Report on
International Religious Freedom'', and the ``Trafficking in
Persons Report'' within 30 days of issuance, and post those
documents on the embassy website along with the English
version.
NATO Interparliamentary Assembly.--The conference
agreement includes such funds as necessary for costs associated
with fulfilling UnitedStates responsibilities with regard to
hosting the NATO Interparliamentary Assembly in 2003.
Interagency Task Force.--The conference agreement
includes such funds as necessary for costs associated with the
establishment of a U.S. Government interagency task force to
monitor the United Nations headquarters renovation project.
Worldwide Security Upgrades.--The conference agreement
includes $553,000,000, the full amount requested under
Diplomatic and Consular Programs, for the costs of worldwide
security upgrades. This funding includes $418,501,000 to
provide full year costs of maintaining base security activities
at current levels. These activities include guard services,
physical security equipment, armored vehicles, personnel,
training and wireless communications.
In addition, the conference agreement includes
$74,000,000 to continue the perimeter/compound security
initiative. Through fiscal year 2002, upgrades had been
completed at 115 posts. With this funding and additional
funding under the Embassy Security, Construction and
Maintenance account, upgrades will be completed at an
additional 71 posts. The remaining 57 posts are scheduled for
completion in fiscal year 2004.
The conference agreement also includes $21,000,000 for
domestic technical and physical security upgrades, $17,302,000
to improve response to terrorist incidents and potential usage
of chemical and biological weapons, and $22,197,000 to support
additional positions in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
including security engineers, security technicians, and civil
service support staff. This increase is on top of 389 new
positions provided in fiscal year 2002, which included 277
special agents, 13 security engineers, 18 security technicians
and 81 civil service support staff. This staffing increase will
ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to address
continuing high threat levels overseas, to improve the
management of overseas security improvement programs, and also
to maintain domestic protective and other responsibilities. The
Department shall submit a detailed spending plan by March 1,
2002, for the entire amount provided for worldwide security
upgrades, subject to the regular reprogramming requirements.
This spending plan shall include a complete and thorough
accounting of prior year security funds.
Right-Sizing the U.S. Government Presence Overseas.--The
conferees expect the Department to continue efforts to develop
interagency mechanisms to better coordinate, rationalize and
manage the overall deployment of U.S. Government personnel
overseas. The conferees continue to expect that right-sizing
can result in significant overall budget savings. Right-sizing
is also discussed under the Embassy Security, Construction and
Maintenance account.
Border Security Program.--The Department's budget request
includes funding of $642,731,000 for the Department's Border
Security program, to be entirely funded through collection of
Machine Readable Visa fees. Since the submission of that budget
request there has been a decline in fee revenue resulting from
a reduction in the number of visa applications received. In
addition, changes in programmatic emphasis have resulted from
new laws as well as Departmental reviews of consular processes,
procedures and policies.
These factors have led the Department to propose a new
fiscal year 2003 budget for the Border Security Program
totaling $616,821,000, a reduction of $25,910,000 from the
original requested level. This adjusted level of operations
includes a program increase of 52 new consular positions,
reflecting projected workload increases in relation to visa
applications, passport adjudications, citizen services and
associated management. The new budget estimate includes
$70,100,000, an increase of $15,000,000 over the original
estimate, in the modernization and support area. This increase
will fund software development to implement collection of a
biometric in the visa and to support an expanded data share
requirement with other agencies.
The conferees urge the Department to continue to work on
an interagency basis to strengthen the visa process to make it
an effective anti-terrorism tool, while avoiding the creation
of unnecessary barriers or delays to legitimate travel to the
United States. In this regard, the conferees expect the
Department to submit a report by March 31, 2003, detailing all
the changes to the visa application review process since
September 11, 2001, and establishing a program spending plan
and timetable for any further improvements or enhancements.
Based on information from the Department, the conferees
estimate there will be $89,727,000 in carryover funds from
fiscal year 2002 available to support the fiscal year 2003
program. The conferees continue to support Bureau of Consular
Affairs efforts to implement the diversity visa program.
Saudi Arabia.--The conferees are gravely disappointed by
reports that American citizens seeking refuge and assistance
have been turned away at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. The conferees expect the Department and the Embassy to
follow the stated Department goal to support U.S. citizens
abroad and those concerned about them in the United States, and
to take every step possible within current law to ensure that
any American citizens seeking refuge in similar cases are not
treated in a similar fashion.
Minority Recruitment and Hiring.--The Department is
directed to provide $1,500,000 to continue its educational
partnership begun in fiscal year 2001 with Hostos Community
College and Columbia University in New York. This model program
will support the Department's ongoing efforts to increase
minority hiring and diversity by facilitating the preparation
of non-traditional and minority students for careers in the
Foreign Service and the State Department. The conferees also
expect the Department to continue base funding for an ongoing
partnership with Howard University. With regard to this
partnership, the funding is provided to support the
Department's efforts to enhance the diversity of the U.S.
diplomatic corps by increasing the number of underrepresented
minorities in foreign relations and international affairs
careers. These resources are to continue and expand the
successful collaborative partnership between the Department and
Howard University to recruit and prepare students from various
institutions with large minority populations for positions in
the U.S. Foreign Service.
Overseas Schools.--The conferees commend the Consolidated
Overseas Schools Assistance Program for its effective work in
improving the quality of education for children of U.S.
citizens living overseas. The program fulfills a dual purpose
of providing a high quality, American-style education for
children of U.S. citizens assigned overseas and introducing the
best in American educational practices to children of and
educators of other nations. In addition, the conferees commend
the Overseas Schools Advisory Council, which helps bring
educational excellence to American-sponsored overseas schools
through the enhancement projects of the Council's annual
Educational Assistance Program. Further, the Council
successfully encourages financial support to these schools from
U.S. corporations and foundations, as well as volunteer
participation in activities of the schools by U.S. firms'
overseas employees and their spouses.
Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC).--The conferees
note the efforts of the ODTC to streamline licensing processes
and to reduce response times without compromising national
security. However, despite improvements, the conferees remain
concerned that compliance with existing regulations is
increasingly problematic for small businesses, and has
contributed to a drop-off in foreign sales for the U.S.
satellite industry. The conferees are aware of additional
concerns that some small businesses active in the manufacture
and export of defense articles are unaware of the existence of
the ODTC and export regulations. To deal with these concerns,
the conferees expect the ODTC, within the level of funding
provided under this account, to provide a point of contact and
start-up guidance to small businesses and other new
registrants, and to ensure they receive appropriate
consideration. In addition, ODTC should develop training tools
accessible to such small businesses, and other outreach
efforts, as appropriate.
Extradition.--The conferees expect the Department to work
with the Department of Justice to bolster efforts to negotiate
effective extradition treaties.
Security of Classified Material.--Consistent with the
report submitted to the Committees on Appropriations in 2002
regarding the number of containers used for storage of
classified material that are not in compliance with Federal
specifications, the recommendation includes such sums as
necessary to continue efforts to replace such locks.
Art in Embassies.--The conferees support efforts to
conduct collaborative art projects for display on-site at U.S.
Embassies. Such projects can create a low-cost medium for
dialogue and interaction, and can increase understanding of
common interests and the free exchange of ideas. Within
available funds, up to $1,000,000 may be used for this
initiative.
New Post Openings.--The conferees are concerned that the
Department is taking actions to establish new overseas posts
before any request is transmitted to the appropriate
Congressional committees, thereby undermining the purposes of
Congressional review and Committee reprogramming requirements.
The conferees remind the Department that the establishment of a
new Department Office or post overseas is subject to section
605 reprogramming procedures. The conferees expect that any
such proposals will, whenever possible, be included in the
Department's annual budget submission, and will include a full
accounting of the anticipated costs of such proposals. The
Conferees remind the Department that decisions by the
Committees on Appropriations to open new posts are based on
overall U.S. foreignpolicy objectives, right-sizing
considerations, and on the resource limitations of the Department. Such
decisions are made irrespective of any unofficial or unauthorized
presence the post might have established prior to the Department's
submission of a formal request to the Committees on Appropriations.
Security Training and Enhancements.--Explosive growth in
numbers of personnel in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security [DS]
has created an imbalance between seasoned and unseasoned agents
that can only be solved with time. The total number of DS
agents now stands at 1,150, with just under half of these
agents having been hired in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The
Committee therefore directs that DS utilize a portion of the
funding provided under Frontline Security Readiness for the
training of new agents.
Additionally, the conferees remain concerned about the
Department's decisions relating to the placement of DS agents.
This is a time of heightened threat to our overseas posts, as
demonstrated by recent attacks against U.S. diplomatic and
military installations around the world. Given this security
environment, the conferees are concerned that too few agents
are stationed overseas compared with the number on assignment
in the United States. The conferees direct the Secretary of
State to submit a staffing plan for the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security to the Committees on Appropriations by June 1, 2003.
At this time of heightened threat to American posts
abroad, the benefits of the security enhancement funds the
Committees have provided to the Department since the Dar and
Nairobi bombings in 1998 are being realized. The most recent
indicator of improved physical security at U.S. posts overseas
came on June 14, 2002, when a suicide bomber detonated a 500-
pound fertilizer bomb outside the U.S. Consulate General in
Karachi. The physical damage to the building was minimized due
to recent security upgrades to the embassy compound. The
Consulate's perimeter wall had recently been reinforced, and
barriers installed between the wall and the street prevented
the vehicle from reaching the building. Shatter resistant
window film also significantly mitigated damage from the blast.
An earlier reconfiguration of interior office space, undertaken
to provide additional blast separation, also proved helpful.
Continual security upgrades to existing properties are as
important as the Department's Capital Security Construction
program. Accordingly, the conference report includes full
funding for worldwide security upgrades.
Host country relations.--The conference agreement
includes up to $2,000,000 out of available funds to continue
the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation. U.S.
Ambassadors serving in less developed countries may submit
competitive proposals for awards for one-time or recurring
projects. Awards will be based on the importance of the site,
the country's need, and the potential of the award to make a
meaningful contribution to the preservation of the site,
object, or form of expression. The Department is directed to
submit an annual report to the Committees on Appropriations on
winning projects.
International Center for Muslim-Western Dialogue.--The
conference agreement for the Embassy Security Construction and
Maintenance account includes funding for the restoration of the
original U.S. consular facility in Istanbul, Turkey. The
conferees direct that the facility be used as an International
Center for Muslim-Western Dialogue, the mission of which shall
be to promote democracy. The conferees direct the Secretary to
collaborate with existing non-profit organizations that focus
on Western-Muslim relations such as the Asia Foundation, the
National Endowment for Democracy, and other U.S.-based centers
for Islamic studies in developing a plan for the creation and
administration of the Center. The conferees encourage the non-
profit organizations involved in the planning of the Center to
play a continuing role both in the administration of the Center
and in the execution of its programs. The Department is
directed to submit this plan to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than September 1, 2003.
Language training.--Several reports have identified a
serious shortage within the Federal Government of personnel who
possess the language skills required for their positions. This
challenge appears particularly acute at the Department of State
where language skills are directly linked to the execution of
the Core Missions. Reliable aggregate data on the language
capabilities of Foreign Service Officers [FSOs] is, however,
not generally available or, when available, is seriously
flawed. The Department has indicated that the primary factor
contributing to its inability to meet its language staffing and
proficiency goals is an overall staffing shortfall of more than
1,100 people, as identified in the Department's Diplomatic
Hiring Report. This report led the Department to propose the
Diplomatic Readiness Initiative, a program under which a
projected 1,158 new Foreign Service Officers will be hired over
a 3-year period. However, the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative
does little to address the specific problem of language
proficiency at the Department. Funds available for salaries
should be leveraged to provide pay incentives to FSOs who
gainexpertise in hard-to-learn languages, to provide an attractive
career path for linguists, to enhance the retention of FSOs with
desired language skills, and to provide ample training opportunities to
FSOs willing to learn a difficult language mid-career. Funds provided
for workforce retention should also be utilized to recruit native
speakers of difficult and hard to fill languages, drawing upon the vast
human resources afforded by a demographically diverse United States.
Language proficiency must be a criterion in the selection of FSOs. If
our diplomats truly are our ``first line of defense'' against foreign
threats, then their ability to converse fluently in the languages of
the countries to which they are posted is critical to national
security. The conferees direct the Department to develop a plan to
address the problem of foreign language proficiency, particularly as it
concerns difficult languages, and to submit the plan to the Committees
on Appropriations no later than July 1, 2003. The conferees further
direct the Department to collaborate with the Committees during the
preparation of the fiscal year 2004 appropriations bill so that
immediate funding requirements associated with improving foreign
language proficiency can be met as soon as possible.
Continuing language education.--Language skills ensure
that dependents of Department of State personnel are not
overwhelmed by isolation and alienation, resulting in lowered
post morale. The conference agreement includes up to
$10,000,000 for continuing language education programs for both
employees and dependents at posts worldwide. Language classes
should also be open to non-State Department (Federal) employees
on a space-available, reimbursable basis.
Office of Foreign Missions.--The conferees are aware of
concerns that the Office of Foreign Missions [OFM] may be more
appropriately aligned organizationally with other management
functions, rather than with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.
The conferees expect the Department to submit a report to the
Committees by June 1, 2003, reassessing organizational issues
with regard to OFM, and including any recommendations for
changes.
International conservation of sea turtles.--The conferees
remain concerned with the increasing threat to sea turtles,
particularly those listed under the Convention on International
Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora [CITES],
from incidental capture by foreign fishing fleets, particularly
in the longline fishery. The Department has ignored Committee
direction for the past 2 years. Specifically, the Department
ignored direction stating that the Secretary should, on an
expedited basis, negotiate strong, enforceable management,
reporting, and data collection measures (including economic
measures) focused on reducing incidental capture of sea turtles
in commercial fisheries under regional management agreements
for living marine resources. These agreements include the
Inter-American Sea Turtle Conservation Treaty, the Inter-
American Tropical Tuna Convention, the International Convention
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the Convention on
the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks
in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (the Multilateral High
Level Conference). The conferees are concerned that no
international agreements specifically addressing turtle by-
catch from longline fishing have been negotiated, and the
Department has negotiated only voluntary initiatives rather
than binding agreements to this end.
The conferees expect the Secretary, in cooperation with
the Secretary of Commerce, to use all appropriate means
available to broaden the participation of other nations in the
Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly
Migratory Species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. Of
the funding provided for the Bureau of Oceans and International
Environmental and Scientific Affairs, not less than $750,000
shall be for negotiating, in consultation with the Department
of Commerce, a binding agreement providing for annual
reductions in sea turtle mortality in the longline fisheries of
the Western and Central Pacific, that shall, by 2008, result in
at least a 30 percent reduction in takes, and thereafter result
in such fisheries meeting sea turtle take levels comparable to
those achieved by the U.S. longline fleet.
Conservation enhancements.--The conferees are concerned
that non-U.S. parties to the International Dolphin Conservation
Program (IDCP), of which the United States is a member, are not
fully complying with the requirements of the IDCP, particularly
with respect to accurate reporting of dolphin interactions and
mortality. The conferees expect the Department, in conjunction
with the Department of Commerce, and in consultation with key
U.S. stakeholders, to evaluate and document any lack of
compliance by the non-U.S. parties to the IDCP with its
provisions, including through on-site visits and discussions
with government officials, observers and others with first-hand
knowledge of country practices, and to submit a written report
describing the findings to the Committees no later than
September 30, 2003. The report should include an evaluation of
compliance with the on-board observer program, including a
comparison of the reporting frequency of national observers as
compared to IATTC observers; reporting of dolphininteractions
and mortality; operational requirements for vessels; the extent to
which vessels with a carrying capacity of 400 short tons or less are
setting on dolphins, and actions by parties to report and follow-up on
infractions identified by the international review panel. The conferees
also expect the Department, in conjunction with the Department of
Commerce, to seek measures to strengthen the IDCP to reduce impacts
from setting on dolphin populations in the ETP other than reported
mortalities, including expanding the application of the IATTC observer
program to include vessels with a carrying capacity of 400 short tons
or less, requiring measures that will reduce cow-calf separation,
limiting the number of sets on dolphins, and limiting the dolphin herd
sizes on which sets are made. Of the funding provided for the Bureau of
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, not less
than $750,000 is for these negotiations.
International trade.--In past years the Department has
attempted to pursue enhancements for international trade
activities that fall more appropriately under the jurisdiction
of the Commerce Department's International Trade
Administration, and in particular under the jurisdiction of the
United States and Foreign Commercial Service. The conference
agreement does not include funding for any new initiatives with
regard to expansion of international trade activities. In
addition, the conferees expect that the Department will not
unnecessarily impede any legal and appropriate technical
discussions between the United States Department of Agriculture
and Cuba's Agriculture ministry regarding health standard
certifications for agricultural products exported from the
United States to Cuba.
Secure Card Technology.--The conferees are aware that the
U.S. Embassy in Mexico City began issuing secure laser visa
border crossing cards to Mexican visitors in May, 2002. The
conferees direct the Department, in consultation with the
Immigration and Naturalization service, to report no later than
May 5, 2003 on the success of this secure visa issuance program
in Mexico City. The report should provide recommendations to
the Committees regarding the expansion of this visa issuance
process to all visa types and the potential for application of
the secure card technology at U.S. foreign missions.
Fingerprint services.--The conferees expect U.S.
embassies and consulates with fingerprinting capabilities to
fingerprint aliens seeking first-time flight training in
aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or more and transmit those
fingerprints to the Department of Justice and other relevant
agencies for the purposes of checking fingerprints against
appropriate terrorist watch-lists.
International Child Abductions.--The conferees remain
concerned about the adequacy of the Department's efforts to
counter the serious problem of international child abductions.
Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Department is
directed to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations
which includes the following information: the country,
location, and number of all known U.S. citizens under the age
of 18 who have been abducted by a parent or relative as the
result of a custody dispute and who are being held abroad in
contravention of U.S. laws or judicial orders; a summary of
actions taken by the Department of State to secure the
repatriation of abducted American children; and a list of
diplomatic measures, including treaties and agreements, that
can be used to facilitate the repatriation of abducted American
children. The conferees expect the Department to complete and
release the State Department's report on compliance with the
Hague Convention on the International Aspects of Child
Abduction. The Hague Convention, which the United States and
many of our Allies have signed, is in place to facilitate the
return of internationally abducted children to their countries
of ``habitual residence'' for custody determination. The
conferees recognize the importance of compliance with the Hague
Convention and request this report be sent to the Committee on
Appropriations no later than March 31, 2003. The conference
agreement includes such funds as necessary to be used for an
international conference on best practices in adoption. The
conference would promote cooperation among the U.S. and other
countries in support of the Hague Convention.
Globalization.--Within available funding, up to
$1,000,000 may be available, if merited, to support the
Globalization Research Network [GRN] research consortium. The
consortium conducts interdisciplinary, international studies of
pressing problems faced by humanity. Any funding allocated to
this activity shall be proposed through the regular
reprogramming process.
Financial Operations.--Over the past several years the
Department of State has made significant improvements in its
financial operations. For the past six years, the Department
has had clean audited financial statements. Additionally, the
Department has been streamlining and centralizing its overseas
and domestic financial operations in Charleston, South
Carolina. The conferees are aware that the Office of Management
and Budget has undertaken an effort to consolidate payroll
operations among the Federal agencies. From Charleston, the
Departmentcurrently pays over 25,000 Americans both
domestically and overseas and over 35,000 local national employees in
180 different countries, bi-weekly, in local currencies. Before the
Department expends any resources to join a consolidated payroll effort,
the Committees on Appropriations are to be notified through the
reprogramming process of any such plans and how this will affect
staffing, and represent a cost savings to the taxpayer.
Changes from the Budget Request.-- As in previous years,
the conferees expect that there will be additional savings
available to the Department, including exchange rate gains and
vacancies in funded positions. The Department will have the
ability to propose that savings be used for needs not funded by
the recommendation through the normal reprogramming process.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND
The conference agreement includes $183,311,000 for the
Capital Investment Fund. In addition, the conferees expect that
$86,000,000 in expedited passport fees will be used to support
the information technology modernization effort, for a total
fiscal year 2003 spending availability of $269,311,000.
The entire amount available under this heading, including
fees, will support investments in new information technologies
and infrastructure to improve the efficiency of Department
operations. Costs associated with ongoing information
technology operations and maintenance are included under the
Diplomatic and Consular Programs account, as in fiscal year
2002.
The conference agreement provides the full requested
amounts for two major technology initiatives:
$94,235,000 for the Classified Connectivity Project
(CCP). This amount will enable the Department to
replace obsolete computer and communications equipment
that posts use for classified operations. The Committee
views this project as the Department's highest priority
technology investment activity, and expects the
Department to achieve installation of CCP connectivity
in all eligible posts by October 1, 2003. The Committee
is willing to consider a reprogramming of funding under
this account if additional resources are required to
achieve this timetable.
$36,500,000 for the OpenNet Plus project. This
amount will enable the Department to complete the
expansion of desktop Internet access to all Department
employees worldwide during fiscal year 2003. The
Committee expects that, by April 30, 2003, 100 percent
of bureaus and eligible posts overseas will have
OpenNet Plus installed and operating, and 100 percent
of Internet users Department-wide will have only one
computer with Internet and Intranet access at their
desktops.
The conference agreement includes a total of $17,000,000
for the Integrated Messaging and Foreign Affairs Systems
Integration (FASI) initiatives, and $7,345,000 for public key
infrastructure requirements. The Department shall report to the
Committee no later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act
on results of the FASI pilots in fiscal year 2002, and a
program and financial plan for fiscal year 2003 to establish
secure interagency communications using a public key
infrastructure.
The Committee directs that the Chief Information Officer
of the Department develop an annex to the existing IT Strategic
Plan which outlines in detail the Department's 5-year strategy
for maintaining and upgrading its existing IT infrastructure.
This strategy will help ensure that the significant investments
made in the last 2 years are not lost, and that the
Department's current IT infrastructure is leveraged both to
capitalize on these prior investments and to meet the needs of
the Department. The Department is directed to submit this annex
to the Committees on Appropriations no later than September 1,
2003.
The conferees direct the Department to submit, by April
30, 2003, an updated performance report for the Classified
Connectivity and OpenNet Plus projects. This report should
include a corresponding implementation timetable, a multi-year
funding requirement table, and specific efficiencies and
savings resulting from each project.
The conferees direct the Bureau of Human Resources, in
consultation with the Chief Information Officer of the
Department, to report to the Committees on Appropriations on
how the Department plans to meet its short and long-term human
capital needs in the area of information technology. The report
should address such issues as pay incentives, specialized
recruitment strategies, and preventing attrition to the private
sector.
The conferees support the trend at the Department towards
the central management of information. The conferees are aware
that, at a time of increased threat to our overseas posts, the
ability to store and manage information, particularly
classified information, domestically can greatly enhance the
security of that information. One technology that appears
particularly promising is the high-assurance virtual wide area
network [WAN]. This technology would allow the Department to
minimize the information stored at post and permit computer
terminals to be ``sanitized'' of sensitive information when not
in use. Within the funds made available under this account for
Centrally Managed Infrastructure, the Department shall
institute a pilot project to develop a high-assurance virtual
WAN architecture and prototype in support of Department of
State activities. Up to $8,000,000 may be made available for
this purpose, subject to reprogramming. The conferees expect
the Bureau of Information Resource Management to collaborate
closely with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) and with
other relevant agencies on this pilot project. This will ensure
that any technologies employed by the Department to centrally
manage its information meet all of the security requirements
set forth by DS and by other relevant agencies. The conferees
direct the Department to present a preliminary plan for this
project within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The conference agreement includes $29,264,000 for the
Office of Inspector General (OIG). The Inspector General
conducts oversight at the State Department and the Broadcasting
Board of Governors. The conference agreement includes funding
for OIG oversight of the Department's efforts to implement
worldwide security upgrades.
The conference agreement includes language, as in
previous years, waiving the statutory requirement that every
post be inspected every five years, in order to provide greater
flexibility to the Inspector General to use resources in the
most productive areas. The Department shall report to the
Committees by July 4, 2003 on the OIG's post inspection regime,
and the need for the continuation of waiver language in future
fiscal years. The conferees believe that the OIG can achieve
the statutory post inspection requirements within existing
resource levels by re-engineering inspection processes and
reprioritizing tasks.
EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS
The conference agreement includes a total of $245,306,000
for the Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs of the
Department of State. In addition to the amount provided under
this heading, the Department expects to receive transfers from
accounts in other appropriations acts for exchange programs,
primarily with nations of east and central Europe, and of the
former Soviet Union. The following chart displays the
conference agreement on the distribution of funds by program or
activity under this account, including an estimated $5,754,000

605 of this Act.
The Committee recognizes that international education and
exchange programs are critical components of U.S. national
security and foreign policy. In light of the tragic events of
September 11, 2001 this type of engagement with the world is
more important than ever. International educational and
exchange programs enable the United States to augment the
foreign language and foreign area expertise of each successive
generation of rising leaders, prepare U.S. students to function
effectively in a global environment through study abroad, and
promote international understanding through professional,
scholarly, and citizen exchanges.
The Conference agreement includes funding for citizen
exchange programs (including continued base funding for the
American Council of Young Political Leaders exchanges and the
Congress-Bundestag Program). With respect to the Congress-
Bundestag Program, the conferees intend that the amount
provided will support 380 exchanges in fiscal year 2003, the
same level as in fiscal year 2002. The conference agreement
also includes funding for African workforce development
exchanges (including funding for the AFTECH virtual university
initiative) and funding for the Disability Exchange
Clearinghouse. The conferees continue to support the goal of
increasing the number and quality of exchange opportunities for
people with disabilities. The conferees expect the Department
to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations within
90 days of enactment of this Act detailing current efforts to
make exchange opportunities available for people with
disabilities and a plan to increase such opportunities in the
future.
The conference agreement includes funding for enhanced
programs to engage Arab and Muslim audiences through
educational and cultural exchanges. The conferees expect this
funding to continue and expand the programs funded from fiscal
year 2002 supplemental appropriations, including Fulbright
Exchanges (including American Studies), English Language
Programs (including English Language Fellows), US/Afghan
Women's Council exchanges, Values/Religious Tolerance programs,
Media Training Exchanges, and American Studies programs. The
conferees expect the Department to allocate at least 15 percent
of the fiscal year 2003 appropriations provided under this
heading to the Near East region, and at least 10 percent of
such funds to the South Asia region. Should additional
recoveries become available under this heading, the conferees
expect the Department to allocate such funds to programs to
engage Arab and Muslim audiences on a priority basis.
Of the funds provided for the Council of American
Overseas Research Centers, the conferees expect that necessary
funds will be for a grant for research to develop a diamond
fingerprinting technology that will facilitate the monitoring
of the international trade in conflict diamonds.
The conferees expect the Department to submit a proposal
for the programmatic and geographic distribution of available
resources (including all unobligated balances and recoveries)
through the normal reprogramming process within 60 days from
the date of enactment of this Act. Within available funds under
this account, the conferees encourage the Department to
consider supporting the Israel/Arab Peace Partners, and African
Career Internship Immersion Programs.
The conferees expect that the overall funding
distribution will conform to the geographical guidance above.
The conferees further expect that this distribution of
available resources will separately identify any amounts
allocated to subsidize the administrative expenses of programs
that are not funded by amounts appropriated under this heading.
The conferees support the continuation of regional
scholars and graduate exchange fellowship programs with the
former Soviet Union, such as the Muskie Ph.D. program, and
expect that these activities will be funded from within amounts
transferred from other appropriations. In the event that these
programs are not adequately funded from other appropriations,
the conferees would entertain a proposal to fund such programs
from this appropriation through the regular reprogramming
process.
The conference agreement includes a limitation of not to
exceed $2,000,000 on the use of fees or other payments received
from or in connection with English teaching, educational
advising and counseling, and exchange visitor programs as
authorized by law.
The conferees are aware of the economic and cultural
exchange program, as well as the proposed ``sister state''
relationship being developed between the Tver Region of the
Russian Federation and the State of Louisiana. The conferees
support these efforts and encourage the Department to consider
providing assistance to the Louisiana-Tver Region of Russia
international exchange program.
REPRESENTATION ALLOWANCES
The conference agreement includes $6,485,000 for
representation allowances. These funds are used to reimburse
Foreign Service Officers for expenditures incurred in their
official capacities abroad in establishing and maintaining
relations with officials of foreign governments and appropriate
members of local communities.
PROTECTION OF FOREIGN MISSIONS AND OFFICIALS
The conference agreement includes $11,000,000 for the
Protection of Foreign Missions and Officials account. The
increase under this heading reflects the addition of protection
requirements after September 11th, including additional fixed
guard posts and increased motorcade, demonstration and
protective detail costs.
This account reimburses local governments and communities
for the extraordinary costs incurred in providing protection
for international organizations, foreign missions and
officials, and foreign dignitaries under certain circumstances.
The Committee believes that local jurisdictions incurring such
costs must submit a certified billing for such costs in
accordance with program regulations. The Committee also
believes that in those instances where a local jurisdiction
will realize a financial benefit from a visit by a foreign
dignitary through increased tax revenues, such circumstances
should be taken into account by the Department in assessing the
need for reimbursement under this program. The conferees expect
the Department to treat such submissions diligently and provide
reimbursement to local jurisdictions on a timely basis if
claims are fully justified.
Of the total amount recommended, $2,300,000 is available
for protection of foreign diplomats and their families
throughout the United States. The Foreign Missions Act of 1982
authorizes the provision of such services when necessary either
at the request of a foreign mission or on the initiative of the
Secretary of State. In these situations, where State and local
authorities cannot provide the security required, the Act
permits the Department of State to employ the services of
private security firms.
Of the total amount recommended, $8,700,000 is allocated
to reimburse New York City for the protection of foreign
missions and officials accredited to the United Nations and
other international organizations. These funds provide for the
costs of guard posts and security escort and motorcade services
to foreign missions and personnel assigned to the United
Nations.
The conference agreement includes language making these
funds available until September 30, 2004.
EMBASSY SECURITY, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE
The conference agreement includes a total appropriation
of $1,263,500,000 for Embassy Security, Construction, and
Maintenance. The conference agreement designates $755,000,000
as available only for priority worldwide security upgrades,
acquisition, and construction, the full amount requested for
such activities. The conference agreement includes $508,500,000
for non-security related costs. The conference agreement
includes full requested wage and price increases for the
Department's Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO)
totaling $12,936,000, which will support 787 positions in
fiscal year 2003.
This account provides funding to manage U.S. Government
real property worth more than $10,000,000,000 in over 200
countries, including maintaining 3,000 Government-owned and
long-term leased properties at 250 posts and leasing
approximately 1,100 office and functional facilities and 8,000
residential units, not only for the Department of State, but
for all U.S. employees overseas. The Department's latest
inspection survey identified in excess of 4,200 maintenance and
repair needs, as well as major rehabilitation requirements.
Worldwide Security Upgrades.--The conference agreement
includes $755,000,000 for security projects, including
$608,550,000 to continue the capital security program of
constructing new secure replacement facilities for the
Department's most vulnerable embassies and consulates. Projects
undertaken under this program will address the highest priority
facilities from a security standpoint. The conferees are
concerned that specific projects proposed in the budget request
may not meet this criterion, and that in previous fiscal years
the Department has proposed to reprogram funds under this
activity for projects that do not address top priority security
vulnerabilities and for projects that will not result, when
complete, in a facility that meets existing security standards.
The conference agreement also includes $146,450,000 to
complete worldwide perimeter security projects and begin a new
initiative to upgrade compound security, including installation
of forcedentry/ballistic resistant roof hatches, vault doors
and power-assisted vehicle barriers.
A proposed spending plan for the entire amount of
available resources provided for worldwide security upgrades
will be submitted through the normal reprogramming process
within 60 days from the date of enactment of this Act. The
Department shall notify the Committees immediately if there are
any facilities that the Department believes face serious
security risks.
Non-Security Base Programs.--The Committee expects the
Department to propose an allocation of any proposed funding for
non-security capital projects through the normal reprogramming
process.
The conference agreement includes up to $53,500,000 for
facility rehabilitation and up to $90,000,000 for maintenance
and repair of buildings. Within the amounts provided, the
conferees expect the Department to allocate funds as necessary:
to renovate the Istanbul consulate to serve as a center for
mutual cultural understanding; to carry out upgrades at the
U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg; and to conduct renovations at the
U.S. Embassies in Dili and Belgrade necessary to establish and
maintain classified activities at post. In addition, the
conferees are aware of proposals to address facilities and
security requirements with regard to the U.S. presence in Rome.
The conferees expect the Department to assess these proposals
and requirements and allocate funding as appropriate within the
funding provided under this heading. The conference agreement
includes full funding for the leasehold program. Within
available funds, the conferees expect the Department to
allocate up to $20,000,000 for the buyout of uneconomic leases.
The conference agreement funding level includes the full
amount requested for Security Management. This amount will
support additional site security measures and cleared American
guards to supervise an increasing number of capital projects.
The conference agreement also assumes $6,000,000 for
headquarters operations, $17,500,000 for information management
and support, and $23,000,000 for renovations of the Harry S
Truman Building.
Right-Sizing the Overseas U.S. Government Presence.--The
conferees continue to be disappointed at the failure to make
discernable progress in the pursuit of an Administration-wide
process of determining the right size and makeup of overseas
posts, including the explosive staffing projections at posts
scheduled for new office buildings. The conferees continue to
define ``right-sizing'' as the reconfiguration of overseas U.S.
Government staff to the minimum number necessary to meet
critical U.S. foreign policy goals. The notion of right-sizing
as a desirable means to improve security and gain efficiencies
implies that the current number of overseas staff is greater
than the minimum number necessary, and that the presence of a
number greater than the minimum number presents an unnecessary
financial and security burden. The conferees are not aware of
any right-sizing analysis to date that has resulted in a
proposed reduction to a country-wide staffing presence.
The conferees strongly encourage the Department to
continue to work toward an interagency mechanism that can
result in meaningful right-sizing. The conferees urge the
Department to adapt, as appropriate, the basic right-sizing
framework developed by the General Accounting Office to link
embassy staffing levels to physical security considerations,
mission priorities, and costs. In this regard, the conferees
support the Department's effort to initiate a consolidation,
streamlining and regionalization of country and multi-regional
staffing in Frankfurt, Germany. The success of this initiative
will be measured largely by the staffing reductions made
possible at less secure locations throughout Germany, Europe,
Eurasia, Africa and the Near East.
It costs two to three times as much to maintain an
employee outside of the United States as it does within the
United States. The conferees agree with the recommendation of
the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, that rationalizing
staffing and operations abroad has the potential for large
budgetary savings. The justification for all facilities
projects funded under this account must include a full
explanation of regional efficiency and security planning, and
related staffing assumptions, and such projects will not be
approved for funding absent evidence of the application of a
uniform right-sizing methodology.
Assets Management.--The budget request designates
$80,000,000 in assets management funds planned for expenditure
in fiscal year 2003. The conferees expect that these funds will
be used for opportunity purchases to replace uneconomical
leases and for other priority capital acquisition purposes. In
addition, as in previous years, the conferees expect that
assets management funds will continue to be allocated in part
to security construction needs. Any use of these or additional
assets management funds in fiscal year 2003 is subject to
reprogramming. In addition, with respect to the requirement
that a reprogramming forany major new start be submitted, the
conferees understand that requirement to mean that rehabilitation or
construction of projects involving ambassador's residences will be
subject to the requirement.
The conference agreement continues language carried in
the bill in previous years that prohibits funds from being used
for acquisition of furniture and furnishings and generators for
other departments and agencies.
Soft Targets.--Recent terrorist attacks have brought into
focus a new kind of threat against our interests abroad,
specifically, threats against so-called ``soft targets.'' The
conferees direct the Department to formulate a strategy for
addressing such threats to locales that are either frequented
by Americans or are symbolic of the United States. The
conferees are particularly concerned about the safety of
American schools abroad, as well as international schools
attended by American children. The conferees direct the
Department to undertake a review of the security of all
overseas schools attended by the children of non-military
United States government employees. The report shall include
information on each individual facility, including but not
limited to the number of American children enrolled at the
school; an accounting of all financial assistance provided to
the school by the Department of State for the past 5 fiscal
years; threat and risk assessments; an evaluation of the
adequacy of the school's security in light of these threat and
risk assessments; and recommendations for immediate steps the
school can take, with the support of the Department, to enhance
its security posture. The conferees expect the Department to
propose a corresponding spending plan of up to $15,000,000 to
address such vulnerabilities from within the resources provided
under this account.
Consular workspace improvement initiative.--The
Department's consular mission is critical to our national
security. Consular workspace must be adequately sized and
outfitted in order to ensure that the processing of visas and
visa applicants takes place in an organized and efficient
manner. To ensure this, and to improve the overall working
environment for Consular Affairs Officers, the conferees direct
the Office of Overseas Buildings Operations [OBO] to undertake
a 3-year Consular Workspace Improvement Initiative. The
conferees are aware that, traditionally, OBO considers posts'
facilities requirements in a holistic manner, and does not
single out specific bureaus for workspace improvements.
However, the conferees are also aware of the direct link
between the quality of consular workspace and the efficiency
and accuracy of consular work. There is a pressing need for
additional consular windows and interview space, enlarged
reception and waiting areas, office space, and document storage
space. The Initiative should identify posts for consular
workspace rehabilitation where errors in visa issuance present
the greatest threat to our national security, as determined by
OBO in consultation with the Bureau of Consular Affairs. The
conferees expect construction to begin on priority projects no
later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The
Committee expects that up to $8,000,000 within the funds
available under this account for facilities rehabilitation may
be used for this initiative.
Marine Security Guard housing.--Marine Security Guards
are essential to the Department's ability to carry out its
mission overseas. In fiscal year 2002, the Department completed
the final phase of a multi-year effort, undertaken at the
insistence of the Committees, to address the long-neglected
capital needs of many Marine Security Guard [MSG] housing
facilities worldwide. The conferees support the Department's
new policy of incorporating MSG housing costs into the initial
cost estimates, and thus the budget requests, for overseas
construction or rehabilitation projects. The conferees note
that MSG housing costs for fiscal year 2003 are embedded within
the capital projects account.
Reprogramming Requirements.--The conferees agree that the
reprogramming requirements that have been applied in prior
years regarding programs under this heading shall continue to
apply during fiscal year 2003.
EMERGENCIES IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE
The conference agreement includes $6,500,000 to enable
the Secretary of State to meet unforeseen emergencies arising
in the Diplomatic and Consular Service. This funding level
anticipates that carryover balances from fiscal year 2002 will
be available for obligation in fiscal year 2003. Funding
provided in this account is available until expended.
The conference agreement includes a provision in the bill
that permits up to $1,000,000 to be transferred from this
account to the Repatriation Loans Program account. This
provision will ensure an adequate level of resources for loans
to American citizens through the Repatriation Loans Program
account should that account require additional funds in fiscal
year 2003 due to an unanticipated increase in the number of
loans.
This appropriation provides resources for the Department
of State to meet emergency requirements in the conduct of
foreign affairs. The Committee recommendation provides funds
for: (1) travel and subsistence expenses for relocation of
American employees of the United StatesGovernment and their
families from troubled areas to the United States and/or safe-haven
posts; (2) allowances granted to State Department employees and their
dependents evacuated to the United States for the convenience of the
Government; and (3) payment of rewards for information concerning
terrorist activities.
REPATRIATION LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conference agreement includes $612,000 for the
subsidy cost of repatriation loans and $607,000 for
administrative costs of the program.
This account provides emergency loans to assist destitute
Americans abroad who have no other source of funds to return to
the United States.
In the past, less than 20 percent of repatriation loans
have ever been repaid. The conferees endorse efforts by
consular services to limit assistance only to victims of
unforeseen circumstances or travelers whose mental instability
presents a risk to themselves or others.
PAYMENT TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE IN TAIWAN
The conference agreement includes $18,450,000 for the
``Payment to the American Institute in Taiwan.'' The conference
agreement provides for the Institute's pay and inflationary
base adjustments. In addition, the Institute is authorized to
collect Machine Readable Visa fees, which are expected to
generate an additional $14,000,000 in revenues in fiscal year
2003, as well as reimbursements from agencies and user fees
from trade show exhibitors.
The conferees expect that the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) will cover anticipated operating expenses in
fiscal year 2003 through a combination of appropriations and
visa fee revenues, and encourages the Institute to continue to
pursue cost saving measures. The conferees expect the
Department to submit by March 31, 2003, an AIT spending plan
for fiscal year 2003, indicating the total amount of estimated
fee collections, the amount of such fee collections allocated
for operating expenses, and the total amount planned for
operating expenses from all funding sources.
The Taiwan Relations Act requires that programs
concerning Taiwan be carried out by the American Institute in
Taiwan and authorizes funds to be appropriated to the Secretary
of State to carry out the provisions of the Act. The Institute
administers programs in the areas of economic and commercial
services, cultural affairs, travel services, and logistics. The
Department of State contracts with the American Institute in
Taiwan to carry out these activities.
PAYMENT TO THE FOREIGN SERVICE RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY FUND
The conference agreement includes $138,200,000 for the
appropriation entitled ``Payment to the Foreign Service
Retirement and Disability Fund''. The amount provided in the
Committee recommendation is required to amortize the unfunded
liability in the system, as documented by the annual evaluation
of Fund balances.
International Organizations and Conferences
CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
The conference agreement includes a total of $866,000,000
for payment of the obligations of United States membership in
international organizations as authorized by conventions,
treaties, or specific Acts of Congress for fiscal year 2003.
The amount provided in the bill is intended to cover
anticipated assessments for membership in international
organizations, including the United Nations. In addition, the
amount provides full funding for anticipated assessments for
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
related North Atlantic Assembly, International War Crimes
Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the
Organization of American States, and the Pan American Health
Organization, among others.
The conference agreement is based on a upward adjustment
of the fiscal year 2003 request based on exchange rate
fluctuations, and also reflects the application of an estimated
$46,739,000 in available balances from fiscal year 2002 that
the Committee has directed the Department to apply to the
fiscal year 2003 assessment for the United Nations regular
budget.
Reassesment of U.S. Membership in International
Organizations.--The conferees note, with approval, the
Department's recent actions to formally withdraw from certain
international organizations where continued U.S. participation
was determined to be a low priority in the context of overall
U.S. national interests. The conferees continue to support the
comprehensive reassessment of U.S. membership in each of the50
international organizations for which funding is requested under this
account. The Department shall notify the Committees in advance of
taking any action to join, or rejoin any international organization.
Reform and Budget Discipline.--The conferees continue to
insist on reform and budget discipline as the highest
priorities for all of the international organizations,
including the development of processes to evaluate, prioritize
and terminate programs. The conferees believe that the onus is
on each international organization and the State Department
representatives to those organizations to reduce overall
budgets and eliminate duplicative activities, excessive
administrative costs, and inefficient operations.
United Nations Regular Budget.--As indicated, the funding
level assumes full payment of the U.S. assessment to the United
Nations (UN) regular budget, as has been provided every year
since fiscal year 1989. This assessment is estimated at
$279,327,000 for calendar year 2002. In order to assure that
the UN achieves the fiscal discipline that the Congress has
insisted upon, the Committee strongly urges the Department to
ensure that the UN takes no action to increase funding for any
program without identifying an offsetting decrease elsewhere in
the regular budget. Toward this end, the Committee expects the
Department to insist on the prioritization of ongoing UN
programs and activities, so that in the event of unanticipated
requirements, budget offsets may be taken from activities and
programs that have already been determined to be lower-priority
by the organization.
The Committee expects the Department to certify to the
Committee by March 1, 2003 that the UN has taken no action to
exceed the approved 2002-2003 budget of $2.63 billion, which is
an increase of $90 million from the previous biennium. Any
proposal to exceed this budget level should be communicated to
the Committee far in advance of the formal consideration and
adoption of such a proposal. The Department shall also report
to the Committees by April 30, 2003, describing any and all
programmatic or administrative reductions adopted in the
current UN biennial budget.
For nine of the international organizations funded under
this account, including the United Nations regular budget, the
payment of the United States assessment for a given calendar
year is deferred until the subsequent fiscal year. As a result,
United States assessment payments for membership in such
organizations are not made until the fourth quarter of the
calendar year. The conferees expect the Department to report to
the Committees by September 30, 2003, on the significance of
this practice with regard to the achievement of United States
multilateral diplomacy goals and the financial operations of
such international organizations. The report should include
recommendations, as appropriate, for addressing any negative
impacts. The report should also address any cost implications
associated with such recommendations.
OECD.--The recommended funding level includes requested
funding for future renovations to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) headquarters building in
Paris. The conferees remain concerned about the scope and cost
of this project, and the need for the United States to assume
the largest funding share for an undefined capital project in
Paris with costs that could exceed $200,000,000. The Committees
expect to review detailed plans, cost estimates, and potential
financing methods through the reprogramming process before
these funds are obligated for this project. Should the
Department experience further exchange rate losses during
fiscal year 2003, the Committees would entertain a
reprogramming of this funding toward other comparatively
higher-priority activities.
IAEA.--The conference agreement includes full funding for
the adjusted request level for anticipated assessments for the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The conferees
recognize the importance of the role played by the IAEA in
efforts to enact stronger global measures to protect nuclear
material and facilities against potential acts of terrorism.
PAHO.--The conferees continue to support the work done by
the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). PAHO has continued
to take the lead in health issues, including border health
concerns, emerging diseases and bio-terrorism that have an
impact on citizens of the United States and all citizens of the
Americas. The conferees encourage the Department to continue to
support PAHO's efforts.
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES
The conference agreement includes $673,710,000 for United
States payments for Contributions for International
Peacekeeping Activities for fiscal year 2003. The conference
agreement provides for the full payment of anticipated fiscal
year 2003 assessments for United Nations peacekeeping missions.
The conferees are aware that prior year balancesof $46,000,000,
plus additional UN credits are available to offset the cost of fiscal
year 2003 assessments.
The conferees are concerned about the continuing lack of
demonstrable progress toward resolution of the Western Sahara
dispute, despite an enormous investment of funds over the past
decade in the UN's MINURSO peacekeeping mission. The conferees
urge the Department to push for a negotiated settlement to the
dispute, and to terminate the costly UN presence. MINURSO was
established to oversee a referendum and settlement program that
has failed to materialize over the past decade and which the
Secretary General and his Personal Envoy have recognized as
unworkable.
The establishment of several large, complex missions over
the past few years has tested the capacity of the U.N. to plan
and manage such operations successfully. The Brahimi report
addressed many deficiencies in U.N. peacekeeping efforts,
including problems in doctrine, strategy, decision-making,
planning, deployment, support and information technology. The
conferees support efforts to improve the performance and
efficiency of U.N. peacekeeping missions through structural and
procedural reforms. The conferees also support efforts to
better limit and focus the goals of such missions, and to set
specific benchmarks for performance and mission termination.
The conferees are concerned that clear, realistic
benchmarks be established and enforced for the performance of
the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (MONUC). The conference agreement includes funding to
cover anticipated fiscal year 2003 assessments for MONUC
totaling $273,226,000. The conferees expect the department to
consult with the Committees on Appropriations, and to submit
the required notifications, prior to any increase or mandate
change in this mission. Specifically, the conferees expect the
Department to certify that the following conditions have been
met with regard to this mission. First, firm benchmarks for
what constitutes a successful mission must be determined,
articulated, and followed. Second, the security of The
Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DROC) neighbors must be
factored in to all of MONUC's strategic and contingency
planning, and must be heavily considered in the negotiation of
a final political settlement. Third, the UN must construct an
arrangement for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the DROC
that, to the greatest degree possible, does not destabilize
DROC's neighbors. Fourth, contingency plans must be developed
and implemented for the safe withdrawal of peacekeepers in the
event of a resumption of hostilities.
The conferees are encouraged by the significant progress
made over the past year toward the establishment of peace in
Sierra Leone. The conference agreement includes full funding
for anticipated assessments for the UNAMSIL mission in Sierra
Leone. In addition, the conferees strongly support the work of
the Special Court for Sierra Leone to prosecute those who bear
the greatest responsibility for serious violations of human
rights and international law. The conferees expect the
Department to consider ways it can support, and encourage
international and private organizations to undertake new
efforts to prevent, respond to, and document crimes,
particularly crimes involving sexual violence, and violations
in West Africa and the Congo.
The conferees continue to support the efforts of the UN's
Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to identify waste,
fraud and abuse with regard to peacekeeping operations, and to
recommend specific reforms to ensure that such practices are
brought to an end. The conferees expect the Department to
provide the necessary support to ensure that the work of the
OIOS is maintained and strengthened as it relates to oversight
of peacekeeping operations.
The conference agreement also includes full funding for
anticipated assessments for the UNMISET mission in East Timor.
As East Timor begins to establish a criminal justice system,
basic social services, and professional police and defense
forces, the conferees support the continued presence and
gradual drawdown of the UN peacekeeping force.
The conferees direct the Department to resume
transmission of UN Security Council reports on peacekeeping
missions to the Committees on Appropriations.
The conference agreement includes language carried in
previous years requiring 15-day advance notice of any new or
expanded mission, together with a statement of cost, duration,
exit strategy, vital national interest, and source of funds to
pay the cost. The conference agreement also retains language
requiring certification that American manufacturers and
suppliers are provided equal procurement opportunities, and
language prohibiting the use of funds under this account for
the costs of court monitoring.
International Commissions
INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION, UNITED STATES AND MEXICO
The conference agreement includes a total of $30,932,000
for the International Boundary and Water Commission, United
States and Mexico (IBWC). The total amount provided includes
$25,482,000 for Salaries and Expenses and $5,450,000 for
construction. The conference agreement includes language
authorizing not to exceed $6,000 for representation expenses.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement for the Salaries and Expenses
account includes $25,482,000. The Committee notes that
fluctuations in the Commission's operations and maintenance
budgets can result in unanticipated cost savings. Should the
Commission experience such savings, the Commission may propose,
through the section 605 reprogramming process, the use of
surplus funds for items not included in the Committee
recommendation.
CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement for IBWC construction provides
$5,450,000 for ongoing projects including: $2,500,000 for
Boundary-wide construction and $2,950,000 for Rio Grande
construction. The conferees note that the Rio Grande American
Canal Extension project and the Colorado River project are both
currently delayed by required, and extensive, environmental
studies. No funding has been provided for those projects for
fiscal year 2003. Reallocation of funding may be proposed to
the Committees under the reprogramming procedures set forth in
section 605 of this Act.
The conferees note that the IBWC has initiated formal
negotiations with the Mexican Section of the IBWC concerning
the provision of secondary treatment to Tijuana sewage in
Mexico. The agreement that results from these negotiations will
represent a significant long-term measure to address Tijuana
sewage. The conferees are aware of concerns over the lack of
progress in this regard, and strongly encourages the IBWC to
forge a workable agreement to ensure secondary treatment of
Tijuana sewage.
AMERICAN SECTIONS, INTERNATIONAL COMMISSIONS
The conference agreement includes a total of $9,472,000
to fund the U.S. share of expenses of the International
Boundary Commission, the International Joint Commission, United
States and Canada, and the Border Environment Cooperation
Commission for fiscal year 2003. This amount includes
$1,143,000 for the International Boundary Commission,
$6,246,000 for the International Joint Commission and
$2,083,000 for the Border Environment Cooperation Commission.
The funding level for the International Joint Commission
includes $2,294,000 for the third year costs of a five-year
study of the water regulation plan governing Lake Ontario and
the St. Lawrence River.
INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES COMMISSIONS
The conference agreement includes $17,100,000 to fund the
U.S. share of the expenses of international fisheries
commissions or related organizations, as well as the travel
expenses of the United States commissioners.
The conference agreement includes $2,100,000 for the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, $12,248,000 for the
Great Lakes Fishery Commission, $2,100,000 for the
International Pacific Halibut Commission, $90,000 for the
International Whaling Commission, $121,000 for the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas, $70,000 for the Commission for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources, $150,000 for the Inter-
American Sea Turtle Convention Commission, and $100,000 for
Expenses of the U.S. Commissioners. The balance of funds in
this account may be allocated, on a priority basis, to other
international fisheries commissions.
Other
PAYMENT TO THE ASIA FOUNDATION
The conference agreement includes $10,444,000 for payment
to the Asia Foundation for fiscal year 2003. The conference
agreement includes funding for enhanced Foundation programs on
human rights, higher education, democratic governance, ethnic
harmony, religious tolerance and legal/judicial reform in
Nepal, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Committee
expects the Foundation to provide a program and spending plan
for these special initiatives to the Committee by June 30,
2003.
The conferees support the Foundation's efforts to
reestablish its program and presence in Afghanistan. The
conferees encourage the Foundation to use its expertise in
developing programs to encouragewomen's political participation
in Central Asia, and specifically Afghanistan.
EISENHOWER EXCHANGE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM
The conference agreement includes an appropriation for
fiscal year 2003 of interest and earnings from the Eisenhower
Exchange Fellowship Program Trust Fund, expected to total
$500,000. The conferees recognize the important and unique role
of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships in the U.S. Government's
worldwide public diplomacy effort. The conferees therefore
expect that Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, Incorporated,
(EEF) will fashion its exchange programs for fiscal year 2003
to reflect the priority within all public diplomacy programs of
building mutual understanding with Arab and Muslim populations
worldwide. In this regard, the conferees expect that the
selection of foreign and United States fellows will reflect
this priority. In addition, the conferees support a nation-
wide, merit-based recruitment and selection process for United
States Fellows.
ISRAELI ARAB SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
The conference agreement includes language that will
appropriate for fiscal year 2003 interest and earnings of the
Israeli Arab Scholarship Endowment Fund, expected to total
$375,000.
EAST-WEST CENTER
The conference agreement includes $18,000,000 for the
costs of maintaining and operating the East-West Center. Of the
amount provided, up to $2,500,000 is intended for one-time
costs associated with improvements to Center facilities.
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY
The conference agreement includes $42,000,000 for the
National Endowment for Democracy (NED) for fiscal year 2003.
The conferees expect that funding provided will allow NED to
provide additional targeted grants to indigenous groups to
build and strengthen democratic institutions in the Muslim
world. The conference agreement also continues funding for
grants to foster Africa's dynamic democracy movements,
including groups in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Within funds provided under this account the conferees expect
the Endowment to increase democratization programs with
Romania.
The conferees reaffirm the role that NED plays in
strengthening democratic institutions around the world. Any
perception that funds are used to directly support a particular
party or candidate, or to support the removal of elected
leaders through unconstitutional means, undermines the
credibility and effectiveness of NED programs. The Committee
expects NED to take all necessary measures to continue to
ensure that all sponsored activities adhere to the core NED
principles.
In order to be successful in its global fight against
terrorism, the U.S. must develop a long-term response that
addresses the root causes of terrorism. This response must
include support to developing countries in the Middle East,
Africa, South and Central Asia, and other regions where
terrorism has flourished over the last decade. NED has an
established network of organizations and professionals in these
regions that work to promote democracy in ways that are
consistent with Islamic tradition. These existing networks can
be used to further the U.S.'s broader objectives in the war on
terror. The conference agreement includes $6,000,000 above the
request for programs that encourage the development of ties
with modernist Muslim groups, foster pro-democracy networks,
support independent journalism, and assist women's business
organizations. The distribution of these additional funds
should be guided by the following four goals: (1) ending
repression, permitting freedom of expression, and introducing
genuine political parties; (2) modernizing economies and, as a
consequence, reducing poverty and inequality; (3) controlling
corruption and establishing a genuine rule of law; and (4)
ending the political abuse of religion and reconciling Islam
with modern concepts of citizenship and individual rights. The
Conferees expect that this funding increase will be distributed
throughout NED's four core institutes in the same manner as
NED's core budget.
The conference agreement includes up to $1,000,000 above
current funding levels to expand a women's rights and democracy
training program for Lebanon's female Shiite educators,
students, and mothers. The conference agreement also includes
up to $2,000,000 above current funding levels for NED to
establish a program for women's rights in Afghanistan. Within
available funds, the NED should increase its support for
independent women's cultural and human rights organizations in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and
Nigeria and for enhanced programs in The People's Republic of
China, including Tibet, Burma, and North Korea.
The conferees expect the NED to submit to the Committees
on Appropriations a financial plan for the entire amount made
available under this heading prior to obligation.
RELATED AGENCY
Broadcasting Board of Governors International Broadcasting Operations
The conference agreement includes $468,898,000 to carry
out United States International Broadcasting Operations for
fiscal year 2003. This account funds the operating and
engineering costs of Voice of America [VOA], Radio Free Europe/
Radio Liberty [RFE/RL], Radio Free Asia [RFA], Worldnet
Television/VOA-TV, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors
[BBG]. The conference agreement provides all requested
adjustments to base for all entities funded under this account
and full requested funding to continue the Middle East Radio
Network (Radio Sawa) initiative.
Of the funds made available under this heading, $965,000
is recommended for the Office of the General Counsel.
Arabic Television.--The United States continues to face
an enormous challenge to provide the people of Arab and Muslim
countries with accurate information about our policies and
values. The conferees support the Board's efforts to expand its
ability to reach audiences in the Middle East. The conference
agreement includes up to $2,500,000 for the development of an
Arabic language television initiative in the Middle East. In
addition, the conferees are aware of prior-year recoveries in
the Broadcasting Capital Improvements account that may be used
for the development of an Arabic television initiative.
Developing quality and attractive news and entertainment Arabic
language programs should to the maximum extent possible involve
the creative talents of the private and not-for-profit sectors.
The conferees urge the Board to integrate new approaches, such
as using private and not-for-profit content providers of Arabic
broadcast programming, to more effectively engage key
audiences.
Reprogramming of Exchange Rate Gains/Other Savings.--As
in past years, the conferees expect that there will be
additional savings available to the Board, including exchange
rate gains and vacancies in funded positions. The conferees
note that the Board will have the ability to propose that
savings be used for additional requirements related to the
Arabic broadcasting initiative, broadcasting to China and North
Korea, and other emerging priority programs through the normal
reprogramming process.
Language Service Review and Research.--The conferees
continue to support the Board's efforts to objectively and
systematically review and evaluate the performance, results,
and importance of every U.S. Government-sponsored international
broadcasting language service and to propose corresponding
reallocations of funds. The conferees endorse this process as a
means to improve broadcast quality and meet emerging program
priorities within limited resources. The conferees commend the
Board for taking steps to consolidate and strengthen the
research function by establishing the Office of Performance
Review. The conferees expect that the Board will be able to
establish comprehensive performance measures and improve
coordination of programming streams across component
organizations, including the grantee organizations. The
conferees support the continuation and expansion of this effort
in fiscal year 2003. The conference agreement assumes total
funding of at least $5,000,000 for the Research function in
fiscal year 2003. The conferees strongly urge the Board to
ensure that foreign policy implications are given full
consideration before adopting language service review
recommendations. The conferees direct the Board to submit a
comprehensive report on Language Service Review results and
corresponding reallocations of funds. The conferees expect that
the continuing language service review effort may result in the
dedication of additional resources to emerging priority
programs, through the normal reprogramming process.
Africa Broadcasting.--The problem of AIDS in Africa is
ubiquitous. Radio broadcasting is an underutilized tool in the
fight against the African AIDS epidemic. Its accessibility to
even the most impoverished communities makes it an ideal way to
transmit information about the disease. Radio broadcasts could
be a major component of sustained prevention efforts undertaken
by the governments of many African countries, humanitarian
organizations, and U.S. assistance programs. The recommendation
includes up to $10,000,000 for Voice of America's Africa
Division for broadcasting to Africa. The conferees direct VOA
to incorporate AIDS education into its regular programming. VOA
is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations on
its progress no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act.
Security of RFE/RL headquarters.--The conferees are aware
that RFE/RL and the government of the Czech Republic have
jointly developed a preliminary plan to relocate RFE/RL
headquarters from St. WenceslasSquare in Prague, the Czech
Republic, to a new and safer location. The BBG must consult with the
Committees on Appropriations on all decisions concerning a future
capital project as they relate to security. RFE/RL is directed to
report to the Committees on Appropriations on all aspects of the
relocation currently being considered. The report should explain
whether it would be desirable, from both a security and from an
economic perspective, to move RFE/RL headquarters to a location outside
of the Czech Republic. The BBG is encouraged to consider Turkey as a
possible host nation for the new RFE/RL headquarters.
Security of worldwide broadcasting facilities.--In the
post-September 11 environment, the broadcasting services no
longer have the luxury of ignoring the security of their
personnel and facilities. The Broadcasting Board of Governors
is therefore directed to develop, in consultation with the
Department of State and other relevant U.S. agencies, a 5-year
capital worldwide security plan. The plan shall be transmitted
to the Committees on Appropriations no later than July 1, 2003.
The conferees remain concerned that adequate transmission
capacity be available to support broadcasting to Iran and Iraq.
The conferees understand the Board is in the process of
identifying additional transmission capacity in the region to
support Radio Free Iraq and its new Radio Farda initiative. The
conferees direct the Board to consult with the Committees on
Appropriations as new transmission opportunities are identified
that will provide strong broadcast signals for all relevant
language services to Iran and Iraq.
Anti-jamming efforts.--The conferees continue to support
initiatives by the BBG to defeat jamming and reach a wider
audience for Radio Free Asia and Voice of America broadcasts to
China, Tibet, Vietnam, and North Korea. The conferees are aware
that new technologies may allow the VOA and RFA to more
effectively defeat jamming efforts. The conferees encourage the
Board to evaluate the usefulness of these technologies and will
entertain proposals to reprogram additional funds for anti-
jamming technologies.
The conference agreement provides funding for the
principal broadcasting entities as follows:
Voice of America.--The conference agreement provides
$154,307,000 for VOA. The conference agreement provides for
adjustments to base and requested funding to continue surge
broadcasting in Dari, Pashto, Urdu, Farsi, Arabic, Uzbek, and
Turkish. The conferees expect the Board to complete the merger
of Worldnet and VOA-TV resources. The conferees understand that
the BBG is in the process of determining final organizational
changes to complete this merger and direct the Board to submit
these proposed changes to the Committees on Appropriations in
accordance with Section 605 of this Act.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.--The conference
agreement provides the full requested amount of $73,086,000 for
RFE/RL, including the requested amounts for broadcasting to
Iran and Iraq. The conference agreements provides for
adjustments to base, including $2,423,000 to continue surge
programming in Persian, Tajik, Uzbek, Turkmen, Arabic, Kazakh,
Kyrgyz, and Azeri.
The conferees commend RFE/RL for developing programming
in Avar, Chechen, and Circassian, and for expanding
broadcasting to the Northern Caucasus. The conferees recognize
the continuing importance of reaching the isolated minorities
of the Northern Caucasus in their native languages. The Chechen
crisis is ongoing and there is still a great need in this
region for objective, uncensored information. Within the
funding provided for RFE/RL, $850,000 is for the North Caucasus
Unit.
Radio Free Asia.--The conference agreement provides the
full requested amount of $27,084,000 for RFA. This amount
includes $1,684,000 for adjustments to base, and will allow RFA
to continue its expanded schedule of broadcasting to China,
Tibet, Burma, Vietnam, North Korea, Laos, and Cambodia.
The conference agreement includes full funding for RFA to
continue daily Uyghur broadcasts. Radio Free Asia's Uyghur
broadcasts are proving successful in northwest China in spite
of top-level officials' efforts to erect a steel wall against
``hostile radio stations from abroad''.
The conferees are supportive of efforts to increase the
number of broadcast hours of both the VOA Korean and the RFA
Korea services. Within the funding made available for RFA, up
to $1,500,000 is for the Korea Service.
The BBG is directed to submit to the Committees on
Appropriations, no later than sixty days from the date of
enactment of this Act, a financial plan including a
distribution of the total resources available under this
account.
BROADCASTING TO CUBA
The conference agreement includes $24,996,000, to remain
available until expended, for Broadcasting to Cuba under a
separate account.
BROADCASTING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
The conference agreement includes $12,740,000 in new
budget authority for broadcasting capital improvements. This
amount will provide for the continuation of base costs for
maintenance, improvements, replacements and repairs, digital
production capability development, and security upgrades at
transmitting stations overseas.
The Board shall continue to keep the Committees on
Appropriations informed on the status of its efforts to acquire
additional transmission capabilities in the Middle East. The
Board shall also continue to keep the Committees on
Appropriations informed regarding costs and results of the
ongoing digital conversion project.
General Provisions--Department of State and Related Agency
The conference agreement includes section 401, permitting
the use of funds for allowances, differentials and
transportation.
The conference agreement includes section 402 dealing
with transfer authority.
The conference agreement includes section 403 prohibiting
the use of funds by the Department of State or the Broadcasting
Board of Governors to provide certain assistance to the
Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.
The conference agreement includes section 404 regarding
the recording of place of birth on certain passport
applications.
The conference agreement includes section 405 regarding a
certain land transfer.
The conference agreement includes section 406 regarding
coordination of programs to combat trafficking in persons. The
conferees have included additional guidance regarding these
programs under the ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs'' heading
in this Statement of Managers.
TITLE V--RELATED AGENCIES
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Maritime Administration
MARITIME SECURITY PROGRAM
The conference agreement includes $98,700,000 for the
Maritime Security Program as proposed in both the House and
Senate.
OPERATIONS AND TRAINING
The conference agreement includes $92,696,000 for the
Maritime Administration Operations and Training account. Within
the amounts provided, $13,000,000 is for the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy construction and maintenance.
SHIP DISPOSAL
The conference agreement includes $11,161,000 for the
disposal of obsolete vessels the National Defense Reserve Fleet
of the Maritime Administration. This program should ensure the
expeditious implementation of a pilot program for export and
disposal of obsolete vessels during fiscal year 2003. Priority
should be given to the most hazardous vessels, including those
in the James River. The conferees expect the MARAD to report
back to the Committees on Appropriations on the vessels
designated for disposal; the comparative condition of the
vessels; the proposed method of disposal, including reefing;
and the projected cost for disposal of each vessel. The
conferees urge MARAD to work with the Environmental Protection
Agency to design an environmentally sound disposal program.
MARITIME GUARANTEED LOAN (TITLE XI) PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conferees include $4,126,000 for the administrative
expenses related to this program.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--MARITIME ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement includes provisions involving
Government property controlled by MARAD, the accounting for
certain funds received by MARAD, and a prohibition on
obligations from the MARAD construction account.
Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $499,000 for the
expenses of the Commission for the Preservation of America's
Heritage Abroad. The conference agreement will allow the
Commission to fund its administrative expenses through
appropriated funds while relying on privately donated funds for
the actual purchase and restoration of property and other
project implementation purposes. The conferees encourage
current efforts to attract private funding to support the work
of the Commission.
Revolutionary War heroes--The conferees support
implementation of phase II of the foreign born revolutionary
war heroes project to the extent that private funding is
available for this purpose.
Commission on Civil Rights
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $9,096,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Commission on Civil Rights for
fiscal year 2003. The Commission investigates charges of
citizens being deprived of voting rights, and collects, studies
and disseminates information on the impact of Federal laws and
policies on civil rights. The Commission was established by the
Civil Rights Act of 1957 and is directed by eight part-time
commissioners. The Commission was created to protect the civil
rights of people within the U.S. and was intended to be an
independent, bipartisan, fact-finding agency. The conferees are
concerned about the present state of affairs at the Commission,
and the Commission's apparent inability to fulfill its mission.
The conferees note that recent Commission meetings have been
held without a quorum of 5 Commissioners. The conferees are
surprised by the Commission's decision to incur additional
expense to hold monthly meetings in cities other than
Washington, D.C. The Commission has stated in its budget
request and in briefings with Committees on Appropriations
staff that it may be unable to meet basic operational
requirements such as payroll processing and rent increases in
fiscal year 2003 at the budget level in the President's
request. The conferees expect the Commission to meet its
requirements in fiscal year 2003 through savings realized in
salary expenses and other operational costs, including travel
and other costs related to Commission meetings. The conferees
direct the Commission to submit, within 60 days after the
enactment of this Act, a spending plan for the costs of
conducting all Commission meetings in fiscal year 2003, making
note of any meeting the Commission plans to hold in a city
other than Washington, D.C. This spending plan shall be
submitted to the Committees on Appropriations pursuant to
section 605 of this Act.
The conference agreement includes language as included in
previous years, which provides (1) $50,000 to employ
consultants; (2) a prohibition against reimbursing
commissioners for more than 75 billable days, with the
exception of the chairwoman, who is permitted 125 billable
days; and (3) a limitation of four full-time positions under
schedule C of the Excepted Service, exclusive of one special
assistant for each commissioner.
Commission on International Religious Freedom
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $2,884,000 for the
Commission on International Religious Freedom, the amount
identified by the Commission as necessary to carry out all
requested activities for fiscal year 2003.
The conferees note that the Commission held only three
public hearings in fiscal year 2002. As an authoritative and
unique resource on religious freedom issues, the conferees
expect the Commission to be more active in fiscal year 2003 in
holding hearings, seminars, and other events involving public
audiences. This may include holding Commission hearings and
events in locations around the United States.
Commission on Ocean Policy
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for
necessary expenses of the Commission of Ocean Policy, to remain
available until expended.
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $1,582,000 for the
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the amount
identified by the Commission as necessary to carry out all
requested Commission activities for fiscal year 2003.
Congressional--Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $1,380,000 for the
Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of
China, an increase of $380,000 above the amount provided in
fiscal year 2002. Within this amount, the conference agreement
includes $3,000 to be available for the purposes of official
representation, upon the joint certification of the Chairman
and Co-Chairman.
Victims Lists Database--Of the total amounts available in
fiscal year 2003, including fiscal year 2002 carryover of
$621,813, the conferees expect that $500,000 will be used by
the Commission to develop, populate, and operate a database of
information on political and religious prisoners in China,
pursuant to section 302(b) of Public Law 106-286. The conferees
believe that a comprehensive and accessible database of
prisoners of conscience in China can be a powerful tool for
Members of Congress, the Administration, NGOs, scholars, and
the public to monitor and call attention to human rights abuses
in the People's Republic of China, including specific cases.
The conferees encourage the Commission to continue
building a staff composed of personnel with comprehensive
experience in the field of human rights, the core component of
the Commission's work. Within the amounts appropriated under
this heading, the conferees expect the Commission to strengthen
staff expertise in this area to better serve as an
authoritative voice on human rights and human rights-related
rule of law issues in China. The conferees urge that the
Commission model itself on the Helsinki Commission, which has
served as a visible and effective advocate for democratic and
human rights development in OSCE member countries since 1976.
The Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's
Republic of China was authorized as part of the United States-
China Relations Act of 2000 that established permanent normal
trade relations with China. The Commission monitors the acts of
the People's Republic of China that reflect compliance with or
violation of international human rights standards and monitors
the development of the rule of law, including the development
of democratic institutions, reform of legal procedures,
transparency of the legal system, and the establishment of an
independent judiciary.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $308,822,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for fiscal year 2003.
The conferees note with concern the apparent lack of
sound managerial and fiscal practices that have resulted in the
Commission's projected shortfall in fiscal year 2003. The
conferees expect the Commission to meet its requirements in
fiscal year 2003 through savings realized in salary expenses
and other operational costs.
The EEOC is directed to submit to the Committees on
Appropriations, no later than sixty days from the enactment of
this Act, a financial plan, including steps the Commission
intends to take to control costs and stay within its fiscal
year 2003 appropriation level.
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that included in previous Appropriations Acts allowing not to
exceed $33,000,000 for payments to State and local FEPAs. This
level of funding will allow the Commission to ensure that State
and local FEPAs receive a contract rate of $500 per charge. The
conferees again encourage the EEOC to use the experience the
FEPAs have in mediation, as the Commission expands its ADR
programs.
The conference agreement also includes language similar
to that included in previous Appropriations Acts allowing non-
monetary awards to private citizens, and up to $2,500 for
official reception and representation expenses.
Federal Communications Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes a total budget
authority of $271,000,000 for the salaries and expenses of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for fiscal year 2003,
of which $269,000,000 is to be derived from offsetting
collections, resulting in a direct appropriation of $2,000,000.
The conferees note with concern the apparent lack of
sound managerial and fiscal practices that have resulted in the
FCC exceeding its authorized full-time equivalent (FTE) level
and the consequent budget shortfall projected in fiscal year
2003. The conferees direct the FCC to consult with the
Committees on Appropriations on the Commission's plan to
control costs and remain within its fiscal year 2003
appropriation and FTE levels.
The conferees are concerned about the declining standards
of broadcast television and the impact this decline is having
on America's children. An analysis of all prime-time
programming has found that overall sexual content, foul
language and violence have tripled over the past decade. In
December 1999, the FCC issued a notice of inquiry regarding the
public interest obligations of broadcasters during and after
the transition to digital transmission. The conferees direct
the Commission to continue to report to Congress on the issues
associated with resurrecting a broadcast industry code of
conduct of programming, that if adhered to by the broadcast
industry, would protect against the further erosion of
broadcasting standards.
The conferees continue to emphasize the importance of the
FCC's commitment to the availability of high quality
communications. In addition to technical quality, the conferees
hope the Commission will continue to take steps toward carrying
out its responsibilities under Title 18 of the United States
Code, Section 1464. The conferees commend recent FCC efforts to
take a more aggressive stance in curbing an assault of obscene
matter over the airwaves while remaining cognizant of the
Constitutional rights of our citizens.
In addition, the conferees laud the recent FCC
enforcement actions against telephone companies operating ``fat
finger'' dialing scams. The conferees encourage the FCC to
continue working to make consumers aware of these scams and to
take appropriate actions against companies operating them.
Federal Maritime Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $16,700,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)
for fiscal year 2003. The conferees expect that any pay and
inflationary increases shall be absorbed through hiring below
attrition and other cost-cutting measures.
The Federal Maritime Commission is directed to provide a
report to the Committees on Appropriation no later than June 1,
2003, on the Far Eastern Shipping Company's (FESCO)
participation in the Grand Alliance Agreement in providing
service in the United States-Russian Far East trade.
Specifically, the FMC should report to the Committees on
Appropriation whether or not FESCO should be reclassified as a
controlled carrier.
Federal Trade Commission
salaries and expenses
The conference agreement includes $176,608,000 for the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), instead of $174,508,000 as
proposed by the House and $175,148,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement provides a $2,100,000 increase,
as requested, to address the physical security needs of the
Commission's headquarters building. The Conferees direct the
Commission to coordinate its physical security enhancements
with GSA to ensure that these upgrades are consistent with
other security upgrades being implemented throughout
Washington, D.C.
The Conferees direct the Commission to study the impact
on underage consumers of the significant expansion of new ads
for liquor-branded ``alcopops'' and report the Commission's
finding to the Committee within six months of enactment of this
Act. The Conferees are also concerned that the alcoholic-
beverage industry has not implemented all of the
recommendations of the 1999 Commission report, ``Self
Regulation and the Alcohol Industry,'' and that only one
industry member has taken action to provide for independent
review of complaints about its advertising. The Conferees urge
the Commission to encourage the industry to adopt stricter
advertising placement standards as well as establish an
independent third-party review mechanism to limit the appeal
and exposure of alcohol advertising to underage consumers and
report back to the Committees on Appropriations no later than
six months from enactment of this bill on the status of the
implementation of these recommendations and whether further
rule-making by the Commission is required.
The Conferees are aware of steps the Commission is taking
to address consumer issues of particular concern to Hispanic
Americans, including the hiring of bilingual outreach and legal
staff, as well as the increased monitoring of Spanish-language
advertisements, enforcement actions and education initiatives.
The Conferees commend the Commission for its efforts to respond
to the concerns of Hispanic Americans and encourages the
Commission to continue its efforts to render effective consumer
assistance.
The recommendation retains requested bill language
prohibiting the use of funds to implement section 151 of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act of 1991
(FDICIA). The Conferees are concerned that the consumer
protection intent of this law may be going largely unenforced.
Further, the Conferees recognize that the Commission, who is
assigned enforcement responsibility under section 151, may not
be the appropriate Federal agency to regulate non- federally
insured depository institutions. The Conferees direct the
General Accounting Office to study enforcement of this
provision, evaluate the risk to consumers if this provision is
not enforced, and make recommendations on which Federal agency
could most effectively enforce this provision. The Conferees
expect this report to be submitted 180 days after enactment of
this Act.
The Conferees are concerned that consumers are not
adequately protected against telephone companies operating
``fat finger'' scams. The Conferees direct the Commission to
work with the Federal Communications Commission to make
consumers aware of these scams and take appropriate actions
against companies operating them.
The Commission released a report two years ago that was
very critical of the entertainment industry and their
persistent and calculated marketing of violent games, movies,
and music to children. In response to this report the
entertainment industry has promised to place tougher
regulations on itself and voluntarily comply with the report's
recommendations. The Conferees believe that the FTC should
continue and expand its efforts in this area and directs the
Commission to continue to engage in consumer research and
workshops, underage shopper-retail compliance surveys, and
marketing data collection.
The Commission is charged with monitoring compliance with
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The conference
agreement ensures the agency is adequately prepared to meet the
challenges of increased fraud on the Internet and the agency's
recognition that Internet fraud is an international phenomenon
since the Internet has no borders.
The conference agreement includes additional funding and
authority to collect offsetting fees for the Commission's Do-
Not-Call initiative under its Telemarketing Sales Rule. The Do-
Not-Call initiative will establish a national database of
telephone numbers of consumers who choose not to receive
telephone solicitations from telemarketers. The Conferees
understand that the Commission has adopted, prior to enactment
of this legislation, the Do-Not-Call initiative as an amendment
to its Telemarketing Sales Rule. The Conferees further
understand that the Commission has developed a spending plan
for the Do-Not-Call initiative. The Conferees recognize that
these additional funds and fee collection authority are needed
to implement the Do-Not-Call initiative, which has received
broad support from, and will provide significant benefits to,
consumers throughout the United States.
Legal Services Corporation
Payment to the Legal Services Corporation
The conference agreement includes $338,848,000 for the
payment to the Legal Services Corporation. The Legal Services
Corporation will provide $9,500,000 in one-time grants
equitably distributed among those service areas that will
receive less funding in FY 2003 than they did in FY 2002
because of census-based reallocations.
Administrative Provision
The conference agreement includes language to continue
the terms and conditions included under this section in
previous Appropriations Acts, except that section 501(a)(1) of
Public Law 104-134 shall not apply to the use of $9,500,000.
Marine Mammal Commission
salaries and expenses
The conference agreement includes $3,050,000 for the
necessary expense of the Marine Mammal Commission. Of the
amounts provided, up to $1,000,000 is available to fund an
international conference, or series of conferences, to share
findings, survey acoustic ``threats'' to marine mammals and
develop means of reducing those threats while maintaining the
oceans as a global highway of international commerce.
NATIONAL VETERANS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for the
National Veterans Business Development Corporation. The
conferees note that the Corporation's authorizing legislation
mandates that it institute a plan to raise private funds and
become a self-sustaining corporation. The conferees encourage
efforts by the Corporation to meet this goal.
Securities and Exchange Commission
salaries and expenses
The conference agreement includes $716,350,000 for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of $776,000,0000 as
provided by the House and $656,700,000 as provided by the
Senate. In addition, $29,439,000 in unobligated prior year
balances previously appropriated is available to the Commission
for a fiscal year 2003 operating level of $745,789,000.
The conference agreement supports the continuation of pay
parity for the SEC's staff, adds additional staff, and provides
the funds necessary to improve the agency's monitoring systems.
The conferees expect the SEC to provide quarterly reports to
the Committees on Appropriations on the status of the
implementation of these funds and the measures it is taking to
restore the public's confidence in the financial markets.
The conferees understand the Commission plans on
receiving 700 new staff and that the majority of these new
staff would be allocated to the Divisions of Enforcement and
Corporation Finance and the agency's inspection and examination
program. The conferees require a spending plan be provided and
approved.
The inability of Commission staff to conduct data-
intensive analyses and examinations has hampered the
Commission's investigative and enforcement efforts. In
particular, the Commission has continued to struggle with the
massive inflows of paper documents received in the course of
its investigations. For this reason, the Committee
recommendation includes an increase of not less than
$47,200,000 for information technology. This funding increase
will allow for the development of a pilot document management
system and the deployment of substantially more robust
analytical tools for SEC examination staff. This increase also
will allow the Commission to undertake a requirements analysis
to determine how best to improve its corporate disclosure
review activities so that investors are provided with enhanced
protections and assurances of the validity of corporate
financial disclosures.
The recommendation funds the necessary costs of
additional security measures now required at the Commission's
new headquarters building as a result of the September 11
attack and continuing threats to Federal facilities.
Exercise of options--The Conferees continue to be
concerned that corporate insiders are enriching themselves at
the expense of the commercial enterprises and stockholders for
whom they work by exercising stock options immediately prior to
companies' financial collapse. In fact, exercising stock
options at times may actually contribute to the bankruptcy of
teetering corporations. Therefore, the Conferees recommend that
the SEC provide monthly updates regarding the exercise of stock
options by corporate officers and directors both electronically
to the Senate Appropriations Committee as well as publicly on
the Commission's Electronic, Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval system (EDGAR). Specifically, the information shall
include every corporate officer or director whose exercise of
options under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act
exceeds $100,000 during each 30 day reporting period. The
Committee recognizes the SEC's effort to begin making these
disclosures available electronically in fiscal 2003 and expects
the Commission to keep the Committee apprized of its progress
in this regard.
The conference agreement includes bill language, similar
to that included in previous appropriations acts, which: (1)
allows for the rental of space; (2) makes up to $3,000
available for official reception and representation expenses;
(3) makes up to $10,000 available for a permanent secretariat
for the International Organization of Securities Commissions;
and (4) makes up to $100,000 available for governmental and
regulatory officials.
SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement provides a total of $736,459,000
for the four appropriations accounts of the Small Business
Administration (SBA). Detailed guidance for the four SBA
appropriation accounts is contained in the following
paragraphs.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $314,457,000 for the
salaries and expenses account of the SBA. Of the amount
provided under this heading, $176,882,000 is for operating
expenses of the SBA. In addition, a total of $138,854,000 from
other SBA accounts may be transferred to and merged with the
salaries and expenses account for indirect operating costs.
This amount consists of $129,000,000 from the Business Loans
Program account and $9,854,000 from the Disaster Loans Program
account for the administrative expenses related to those
accounts. The conferees also anticipate that the SBA will have
an additional $3,000,000 in fee receipts available for
operating expenses. This will result in a total availability of
$318,736,000 for the operating expenses of the SBA, an increase
of $15,400,000 above the comparable fiscal year 2002 amount.
In addition, the conference agreement includes language
under the Disaster Loans Program account providing that
$108,000,000 of the amount provided for administrative expenses
may be transferred to and merged with the salaries and expenses
account for the direct administrative costs of disaster loan
making and servicing.
The conference agreement includes requested language
authorizing $3,500 for official reception and representation
expenses, as well as language authorizing the SBA to charge
fees to cover the cost of publications and certain loan
servicing activities. The language also permits revenues
received from all such activities to be credited to the
salaries and expenses account to be available for carrying out
these purposes without further appropriations. The conference
agreement includes the full amount requested for Low
Documentation Processing Centers.
The conferees support efforts by the SBA to examine and
implement organizational changes, both in Washington, DC and in
the field, that result in greater operational efficiencies,
cost savings, and improved delivery of SBA services to small
businesses nationwide and look forward to the submission of
subsequent detailed workforce transformation plans.
The conference agreement does not include requested
language allowing the SBA to retain up to $3,000,000 of
increased collections of delinquent debt for qualified
expenses.
Systems Modernization--The conferees note that
$32,000,000 has been appropriated for systems modernization at
the SBA over the past four years, including funding for the
loan monitoring system (LMS) and the joint accounting and
administrative management system project (JAAMS). The conferees
remain concerned about the lack of progress by the SBA in
delivering tangible and timely systems improvements. The
conferees expect that the SBA will use remaining balances
obligated to FEDSIM in prior fiscal years for priority systems
projects, including core LMS acquisitions, implementation of
phase II of JAAMS, or effective alternatives that bring about
meaningful systems improvements. Systems modernization
expenditures during fiscal year 2003 from funds provided in
previous fiscal years shall be subject to the submission of
project spending plans through the reprogramming process in
accordance with section 605 of this Act.
Non-Credit Programs--The conference agreement includes
the following for the non-credit programs of the SBA:
Regulatory Fairness Boards/National Ombudsman...........     500,000
Advocacy Research.......................................    1,100,000
Veterans Programs.......................................     750,000
BusinessLINC............................................    2,000,000
7(j) Technical Assistance Programs......................    1,500,000
Small Business Development Centers......................   89,000,000
SCORE...................................................    5,000,000
Women's Business Centers................................   12,500,000
Women's Business Council................................     750,000
Native American Outreach................................    2,000,000
Drug-free Workplace Program.............................    2,000,000
Business Information Centers............................     475,000
Microloan Technical Assistance..........................   15,000,000
PRIME Technical Assistance..............................    5,000,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total, non-credit initiatives.......................   137,575,000
Funding for any non-credit program not listed above shall
be subject to the availability of funds and will be considered
by the Committee on Appropriations in accordance with the
section 605 of this Act.
Of the amounts provided for the Small Business
Development Center (SBDC) program, $2,000,000 is to continue
the SBDC defense transition program and $1,000,000 is for a
regulatory compliance simplification program to increase
coordination of environmental, Occupational Health and Safety
Administration and Internal Revenue Service compliance
requirements and to avoid duplication among programs for
compliance assistance to small businesses. The conferees
believe that the Small Business Development Centers provide
useful services to small businesses nationwide. Federal funding
constitutes the seed funding for this program, which is
leveraged by State, local and private funds.
The conferees expect that within the overall amount
provided under this account, full funding will be provided for
the operations of the Office of Advocacy, to include $1,100,000
for Advocacy Research. The conferees direct the Office of
Advocacy to document and report to the Committees on
Appropriations by September 30, 2003 the number of small
businesses owned by people with disabilities served by SBA
credit and non-credit programs.
The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 to continue
funding for a drug-free workplace demonstration program to
provide technical assistance to small business concerns seeking
to start a drug-free workplace program.
The conference agreement includes $1,500,000 for SBA's
7(j) Technical Assistance programs. Within this amount, funding
is provided to continue executive education programs and
programs to help small businesses adapt to a paperless
procurement environment. Funding is also provided to continue
minority enterprise development week activities. The conferees
expect that the remaining balance of 7(j) funds will be awarded
through the grants solicitation process.
The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for a Native
American initiative. The conferees expect that this initiative
will assist small business and economic development only in the
most disadvantaged tribal areas. The conferees realize that not
all Native American tribes, particularly those in remote areas
experiencing severe economic hardship, may be aware of this and
other SBA programs. The conferees expect the SBA to develop a
strong outreach capacity with this initiative to ensure that
underserved Native American tribes have the opportunity to
participate in this program and other SBA non-credit and loan
programs. The conferees direct the SBA to submit a spending
plan for this initiative by April 30, 2003, through the regular
reprogramming process.
Finally, the conferees direct the SBA to submit a report
to the Committees on Appropriations no later than March 31,
2003 listing all personnel reassignments and lateral personnel
actions executed at the GS-15 and senior executive service
career civil service levels, over the past three fiscal years.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The conference agreement includes $12,422,000 for the
Office of Inspector General of the Small Business
Administration. The conference agreement assumes that, as in
fiscal year 2002, the appropriation under this heading will be
supplemented by an additional $500,000, which may be
transferred to this account, from the administrative expenses
of the Disaster Loans Program account for oversight costs
related to that program. The conference agreement includes
resources for continued oversight of SBA's business loan
portfolio and SBA's administration of the 7(a) and disaster
loan programs and non-credit programs. The conferees expect the
office to report on its progress in reviewing and auditing the
agency's financial management systems.
BUSINESS LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conference agreement includes $218,086,000 under this
account, consisting of: $85,360,000 for the Business Loans
Program account for subsidies for guaranteed business loans;
$3,726,000 for subsidies for direct business loans; and
$129,000,000 for administrative expenses related to business
loan programs. The amount provided for administrative expenses
may be transferred to and merged with the appropriation for SBA
salaries and expenses to cover the common overhead expenses
associated with business loans. In addition, the conference
agreement includes a provision, also carried in previous years,
which allows up to $45,000,000 to remain available for two
fiscal years.
7(a) Business Loan Program--The SBA 7(a) Business Loan
Program serves as an important source of capital for America's
small businesses. Each year, 40,000 or more small business
concerns, who cannot obtain comparable credit elsewhere, turn
to the 7(a) program for critical financing. The conferees have
been concerned throughout the fiscal year 2003 budget process
that the requested amount of $85,360,000 for 7(a) budget
authority would not provide for a credible business loan
program level for fiscal year 2003, absent a correction to the
SBA's subsidy rate calculation. Further, the conferees note
that schemes put forth by the SBA in the budget request to
offset the shortfall in the 7(a) Business Loan program never
materialized, including high carryover balance estimates. As a
result, the SBA has depended on solutions predicated on the
enactment of separate authorization and appropriation measures
to achieve an adequate program level. In 2001, the GAO
estimated that on a cumulative basis since 1992, the SBA
overestimated the cost of the 7(a) program by approximately
$958 million using inflated subsidy rate calculations, similar
to those used for fiscal year 2003. The conferees understand
that during fiscal year 2002, the SBA and the Office of
Management and Budget developed a new econometric model to
address flaws in the subsidy rate methodology to more
accurately estimate defaults for the 7(a) Loan Program. The
conferees support a recalculation of the 7(a) subsidy rate
using this new econometric method in fiscal year 2003. In
addition, the conferees direct the SBA to develop similar, more
accurate econometric models during this fiscal year for use in
other SBA loan and financing programs, especially the 504 Loan
Program. The conferees expect the SBA to put forward credible
program proposals for the 7(a) Business Loan Program account in
future fiscal years.
7(a) Business Loan Cap--Beginning October 1, 2002, the
SBA imposed a $500,000 cap on the maximum loan size of 7(a)
business loans with the justification that funding under any
fiscal year 2003 continuing resolution would limit the amount
of available funds for 7(a) and require the SBA to limit the
size of individual loans. The conference agreement includes the
requested amount of new budget authority for the 7(a) Loan
Program for fiscal year 2003. The conferees therefore expect
that, upon enactment of this Act, the SBA will remove the 7(a)
loan cap or submit a written justification to the Committees on
Appropriations and the Small Business Committees as to the
necessity of such a cap.
The conferees support the participation of credit unions
as authorized lenders for the guaranteed loan programs of the
SBA, in accordance with the Small Business Act, as amended, and
State and Federal regulatory requirements.
DISASTER LOANS PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conference agreement includes $191,494,000 for the
Disaster Loans Program Account for loan subsidies and
associated administrative expenses. The conference agreement
includes new budget authority of $73,140,000 for the subsidy
costs of disaster loans, which when combined with estimated
recoveries and balances of $38,806,000 will provide for a loan
program level of over $800,000,000, which represents an average
annual disaster loan program level.
The conference agreement includes $118,354,000 for
administrative expenses of carrying out the program, which may
be transferred to and merged with appropriations for salaries
and expenses. The conference agreement includes language
specifying that, of the amount provided for administrative
expenses, $108,000,000 is for the direct administrative
expenses of loan making and loan servicing, and $9,854,000 is
for indirect administrative expenses. The conference agreement
also includes language requiring that any amount in excess of
$9,854,000 transferred to the salaries and expenses account for
indirect administrative expenses shall be subject to
reprogramming requirements, as detailed under section 605. In
addition, the conference agreement retains language
transferring $500,000 of the amount provided for administrative
expenses to the Office of Inspector General for audits and
reviews of the disaster loan portfolio.
State Justice Institute
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for the
State Justice Institute (SJI), as proposed by the House instead
of $3,100,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The SJI is a private, non-governmental organization,
which awards grants to improve the administration of justice in
State courts. In addition to grants provided by SJI, State
courts are also eligible to receive funding from many Office of
Justice Programs' accounts such as the Byrne Formula program,
Drug Courts, Criminal Identification Technology Act programs,
Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative, the Gun Violence
Reduction Program, Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block
Grant Program, Criminal Records Upgrade programs, Child Abuse
Training for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners, Closed-
Circuit Televising of Testimony for Children, and Violence
Against Women--STOP Grants.
The fiscal year 2002 Conference Report recommended
discontinuing Federal funding for this program in fiscal year
2003 and encouraged SJI to solicit private donations and
resources from State and local agencies. The Conferees
understand that the Institute has not been successful in its
efforts to obtain non-Federal funds and has therefore included
$3,000,000 to keep SJI operating. The Conferees encourage SJI
to continue to solicit donations in order to fund its programs
including asking for support from State, local and national bar
associations. The Committees on Appropriations have received
many letters of support for SJI from these organizations and
State court judges. The Conferees feel that the bar
associations and the States, who are the beneficiaries of SJI's
work, should contribute to funding its programs.

the managers:
TITLE I--FEDERAL FUNDS
FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR RESIDENT TUITION SUPPORT
The conference agreement includes $17,000,000 for a
Federal payment for resident tuition support as proposed by
both the House and Senate.
Language was included in the District of Columbia
Appropriations Act, 2002 requiring the Resident Tuition Support
Program Office and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to
provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations
of the House of Representatives and Senate on the use of
resident tuition support funds by object class. The conferees
are concerned that these reports have not been forthcoming. The
conferees have included this reporting requirement again in the
fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill and expect the Chief
Financial Officer to submit these reports in a timely manner.
The conferees request that the Chief Financial Officer include
with the quarterly report due March 31, 2003, a second report
reviewing the program, by quarter and in summary, since its
inception.
FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING AND SECURITY COSTS IN THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 for a
Federal payment for emergency planning and security costs in
the District of Columbia as proposed by both the House and
Senate. These funds are to reimburse the District for overtime
expenses related to providing security at events related to
Federal government activities and for costs of providing
support to respond to immediate and specific terrorist threats
or attacks in the District of Columbia.
The agreement includes a provision as proposed by the
House to provide that this funding is available only after
notice of its proposed use has been transmitted by the
President to the Congress and such amount has been apportioned
pursuant to chapter 15 of title 31, U.S.C. The Senate bill
included a provision to require the Chief Financial Officer to
submit a report, within 15 days of an expenditure, to the
President and the Committees on Appropriations of the House of
Representatives and Senate detailing the expenditure of funds
for public safety purposes.
The agreement also includes a modified provision to
require that the Office of Management and Budget, in
consultation with the United States Park Police, National Park
Service, Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation,
United States Protective Service, Department of State, and the
General Services Administration, review the National Capital
Planning Commission study on ``Designing for Security in the
Nation's Capital'' and report on the steps each agency will
take to improve aesthetic the appearance of security measures
no later than April 11, 2003. The Senate bill included a
similar provision, but required the report no later than
February 5, 2003. The House had no similar provision.
FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR HOSPITAL BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS IN THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA
The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for a
Federal payment for hospital bioterrorism preparedness in the
District of Columbia as proposed by the Senate. The House had
no similar provision. Of this amount, $5,000,000 is for the
expansion of quarantine facilities and the establishment of a
decontamination facility at Children's National Medical Center
and $5,000,000 is for construction of containment facilities at
the Washington Hospital Center.
FEDERAL PAYMENT TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS
The conference agreement includes $161,943,000 for a
Federal payment to the District of Columbia courts, instead of
$160,545,000 as proposed by the House, and $166,193,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Included in this amount is $1,500,000
above the President's request for the Integrated Justice
Information System as proposed by both the House and Senate.
The agreement includes a provision as proposed by the
Senate to allow the District of Columbia courts to reallocate
not more than $1,000,000 of the funds provided under this
heading among items and entities funded under this heading 30
days after providing written notification to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate. The
House had no similar provision.
The agreement also includes a provision proposed by the
Senate to exempt the District of Columbia courts from violating
section 446 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act or any
provision of subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 31, United
States Code, on the use of interest earned on the Federal
payment provided in the 1998 appropriations Act during fiscal
year 1998. The House had no similar provision.
The conference agreement does not include funding or
contract authority for guardian ad litem representation as
proposed by the Senate under this heading. The House had no
similar provisions. These provisions are addressed under
Defender Services.
DEFENDER SERVICES IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS
The conference agreement includes $17,100,000 for
Defender Services in District of Columbia courts. In addition,
the conferees direct Defender Services to use $16,400,000 of
unobligated balances to provide a total program level of
$33,500,000, instead of $32,000,000 as proposed by the House,
and $34,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Defender Services is
currently carrying an unobligated balance of $20,673,000. The
conferees understand that costs in this program have
historically been difficult to predict and there is a need to
carryover some unobligated balances from year to year to ensure
adequate financing of representation for vulnerable children
and families and indigent defendants. However, the conferees
believe the courts need to develop a better way of tracking
these costs and request a preliminary report on how to achieve
this goal no later than April 30, 2003.
The conference agreement includes $1,500,000 to provide
guardians ad litem to abused and neglected children in the
District of Columbia Family Court. The agreement also includes
language to allow the courts to enter into contractual
agreements to provide guardian ad litem representation,
training, technical assistance, and/or other services to
improve the quality of guardian ad litem representation,
including infrastructure development, as necessary. The
conferees urge the courts to enter into these agreements with
entities that have expertise in representing abused and
neglected children, child welfare, adoption, guardianship,
special education, and domestic violence.
The agreement does not include a provision as proposed by
the House to allow unobligated funds from previous years to be
used toward the portion of the amount under this heading which
is attributable to increases in the maximum amounts which may
be paid for representation services in the District of Columbia
courts. The Senate bill contained no similar provision.

The conferees are concerned about the increasing costs of
delivering services to special education students. Several
factors are responsible for these increases, many of which are
interrelated, such as the increase in the special education
population and the number of non-public placements. The
conferees commend the Mayor and the Board of Education for

budget submission to dedicate $27,000,000 in local funds for

$3,000,000 in Federal funds to create additional campuses that

Sports Complex at Kenilworth Park, NE., Washington, D.C., a
portion of which is owned by the National Park Service. The
site, an area of approximately 50 acres, was a District
landfill until the late 1960's when the landfill was capped.
The National Park Service has conducted a Preliminary
Assessment/Site Investigation and a Remedial Investigation/
Feasibility Study at the site. The latter study is in draft and
has been coordinated with the District and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Region III. As a result of regulatory
reviews, the District has requested a Human Health Risk
Assessment from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and the EPA Region III has extensive comments that will result
in further investigations and require at least a year or more
to complete.
The conferees urge the District of Columbia, specifically
the D.C. Department of Recreation and D.C. Sports and
Entertainment Commission to work with the National Park Service
to develop a land use plan for the development of Kenilworth
Park that could be implemented in conjunction with remediation
and report the results of that effort to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate no
later than six months after enactment. The conferees recognize
that before any plan can be implemented for this site, the
environmental investigations and subsequent remediation will
have to be completed.

The language and allocations set forth in House Report
107-681 and the Senate explanatory statement as delineated in
the Congressional Record of January 15, 2003, pages S492
through S546, should be complied with unless specifically
addressed to the contrary in the conference report and
statement of the managers. Such language should be considered
approved by the committee of conference. The statement of the
managers, while repeating some report language for emphasis,
does not intend to negate the language referred to above unless
expressly provided herein. In cases where both the House report
and Senate explanatory statement address a particular issue not
specifically addressed in the conference report or joint
statement of managers, the conferees have determined that the
House report and Senate explanatory statement are not
inconsistent and are to be interpreted accordingly. In cases in
which the House or Senate have directed the submission of a
report, such report is to be submitted to both House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--CIVIL
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY
Corps of Engineers--Civil
The summary tables at the end of this title set forth the
conference agreement with respect to the individual
appropriations, programs, and activities of the Corps of
Engineers. Additional items of the conference agreement are
discussed below.
The conferees remain concerned about the huge and
increasing backlog of infrastructure development, maintenance,
and repair over which the Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction.
The Administration's proposed fiscal year 2003 budget would
have caused the backlog of unconstructed projects to increase
from $40,000,000,000 to $44,000,000,000, and ignores an
accelerating critical maintenance backlog which would increase
from $702,000,000 to $884,000,000. This maintenance backlog
will soon become entirely unmanageable under the weight of an
aging and crumbling inventory. Proposing no new studies and
only one new construction start, under funding ongoing
projects, and providing minimal operation and maintenance
funding for completed projects leads the conferees to believe
that the budget request may have been influenced by very narrow
interest groups rather than the needs of the country. In the
face of such an irresponsible position, the Congress has no
option but to step forward in support of these vital projects.
The conferees are concerned that Corps of Engineers
technical and planning capabilities have diminished over the
past decade. This diminished capability has been evident in
recent studies, such as the Upper Mississippi and Illinois
Waterway Navigation Study and the Delaware River Deepening
project. The conferees urge the Corps of Engineers to review
ways in which it can improve its capability, including
concentrating its technical and planning expertise in regional
centers. The Corps should report back to the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees within one year on its findings.
GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS
The conference agreement appropriates $135,019,000 for
General Investigations instead of $143,680,000 as proposed by
the House and $148,304,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the Napa
River Salt Marsh Restoration project in California, $900,000 to
complete the feasibility study, and $100,000 to initiate
preconstruction engineering and design.
The conference agreement does not include funds for the
Port of Stockton, California, study proposed by the House.
Funds for this work are included in the amount provided for the
San Francisco Bay to Stockton, California, project in the
Construction, General, account.
The conference agreement includes $3,073,000 for the
Corps of Engineers to complete the feasibility study and
initiate preconstruction engineering and design for the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Comprehensive Basin study in
California.
The conference agreement does not include funds in this
account for the Treatment of Dredged Material from Long Island
Sound, Connecticut, project. Funds for the project are included
in the Operation and Maintenance, General, account.
The conference agreement includes $500,000 for the Corps
of Engineers to perform a General Reevaluation Report for the
Federal navigation project at St. Petersburg Harbor, Florida.
The conferees have provided $450,000 for the Chesapeake
Bay Shoreline Erosion, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania,
study, including $100,000 to initiate the shoreline erosion
portion of the feasibility study.
The conference agreement includes $1,500,000 for the
Great Lakes Navigation System study. The conferees have
included language in the bill allowing the Secretary, in
pursuing this study, to partner with, and accept contributions
from, the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and
agents of the government of Canada. The conferees understand
the need for an evaluation of the existing physical structures
of the St. Lawrence Seaway to ensure the future viability of
the system. However, the conferees are concerned about the
scope of the ongoing study, primarily with respect to the
environmental impact on the Seaway system as a whole and the
St. Lawrence River in particular. Any significant disruption of
the delicate balance of the St. Lawrence/Great Lakes ecosystem
could have a detrimental impact on critical habitats and
adversely affect the region's critical recreation, commercial
and tourism industries. The conferees direct the Corps of
Engineers to take into consideration the recreational,
commercial, environmental and tourism impacts of any changes to
the Great Lakes Ecosystem, including impacts to the St.
Lawrence Seaway as the Corps conducts its Great Lakes
Navigation System study.
The conference agreement includes $150,000 for the Corps
of Engineers to continue shoreline monitoring and undertake
other preconstruction engineering and design activities for the
Manteo (Shallowbag) Bay, North Carolina, project. The conferees
are aware that there are significant issues that remain to be
resolved before this project can proceed to construction.
The conference agreement includes $800,000 for the
Mahoning River Environmental Dredging, Ohio and Pennsylvania,
study, including $100,000 to study the need for environmental
dredging of the Mahoning River within the State of
Pennsylvania.
The conferees have provided $200,000 for continuation of
the riverfront project in Cincinnati, Ohio. The conferees
understand that the City has accelerated the planning and
design of the project using non-Federal funds. It is the sense
of the conference that these funds should be counted toward any
non-Federal cost-sharing requirement. Therefore, the funding
provided is to be used for assistance with the development of
design and environmental compliance documentation.
The conferees have provided $650,000 for the Walla Walla
River Watershed, Oregon and Washington, study, including
$100,000 for the Corps of Engineers to work with the Walla
Walla Watershed Alliance to investigate restoration of riparian
habitat and river flow improvements in the basin.

for hurricane evaluation studies in the State of Hawaii and
U.S. Territories.
The conferees have provided $8,000,000 for the Flood
Plain Management Services program. Within the funds provided,
the conferees expect the Corps of Engineers to carry out the
work described in the House Report and Senate Explanatory
Statement, including $1,000,000 to continue the foundational
geographic information system for flood plain management in
East Baton Rouge Parish in Louisiana.
The conference agreement includes $5,250,000 for Other
Coordination Programs. Within the amount provided, the
conferees direct the Corps of Engineers to undertake the
activities described in the Senate Explanatory Statement.
The conference agreement includes $6,500,000 for the
Planning Assistance to States program. Within the funds
provided, the conferees expect the Corps of Engineers to
undertake the activities described in the House Report and
Senate Explanatory Statement except for the work described in
the House Report for Gwinnett County, Georgia, and the work in
Alaska described in the Senate Explanatory Statement, which has
been funded under the Tribal Partnership Program authorized by
section 203 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. In
addition, the conference agreement includes $300,000 for the
statewide watershed management assessment for the State of
Alabama.
Within the amount provided for Research and Development,
$2,000,000 is provided for innovative technology demonstrations
for urban flooding and channel restoration. The conferees
encourage the Corps of Engineers to cooperate with the Urban
Water Research Program of the Desert Research Institute of
Nevada in carrying out these demonstrations. In addition,
$500,000 is provided for submerged aquatic vegetation research
as described in the Senate Explanatory Statement.
The conferees have agreed to include language in the bill
proposed by the House related to the Southwest Valley Flood
Damage Reduction study in New Mexico.
The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the
House regarding the water resources needs of the central Gulf
Coast area.
CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL
The conference agreement appropriates $1,756,012,000 for
Construction, General instead of $1,831,030,000 as proposed by
the House and $1,636,602,000 as proposed by the Senate.
In the process of arriving at the agreed-upon
distribution of funding, the conferees were aware of, and took
into consideration, the effects on the capability of the Corps
of Engineers to execute its fiscal year 2003 program of having
functioned for nearly half the year under a series of
continuing resolutions. Recognition of the restrictions
associated with this mode of operation, and their inevitable
impact, compelled the conferees to make several changes from
the program that would have been enacted earlier.
The conference agreement includes $19,000,000 for the
Corps of Engineers to continue construction of the Rio Salado
project in Arizona.
The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for the
Sacramento Area, California, project for the Corps of Engineers
to carry out the activities described in the House Report.

The conferees are aware that section 312 of the Water Resources
Development Act of 1999 directed the Secretary to carry out the
Captiva Island segment of the Lee County project in accordance
with section 206 of the Water Resources Development Act of
1992; and also that section 309 of the Water Resources
Development Act of 2000 authorized the Secretary to carry out
the Estero and Gasparilla segments of the same project in
accordance with section 206 of the Water Resources Development
Act of 1992. The conferees urge the Secretary of the Army to
enter into the required project cooperation agreements for the
Captiva, Estero, and Gasparilla segments of the Lee County,
Florida, project within six months of enactment of this Act
into law and to include funds for these segments in future
annual budget requests to Congress.
None of the funds provided for the Olmsted Locks and Dam
project are to be used to reimburse the Claims and Judgment
Fund.
The conferees continue to recognize the vital importance
of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock, Louisiana, project
and direct the Corps of Engineers to take every practicable
action to ensure that construction proceeds expeditiously and
that project benefits are delivered with dispatch.
The conferees have provided $750,000 for the Mississippi
River Gulf Outlet, Louisiana, project for the Corps of

Springs, Battle Mountain, Virgin Valley, Lawton-Verdi, and
Esmeralda County.
The conferees are aware that the Corps of Engineers has
made significant progress during calendar year 2002 to
reorganize the Acequias Irrigation System construction project
in New Mexico. The conferees are concerned, however, that the
State of New Mexico's Interstate Stream Commission is facing
funding shortfalls and is having difficulty garnering the
needed resources as the non-Federal sponsor of the project. In
addition, the conferees are also aware that there are delays in
both the community ditch in northwest New Mexico, as well as in
the Cuchillo project. The conferees continue to support this

and Idaho. Within the funds provided, $300,000 is for a
reconnaissance level investigation of Columbia River flood
control operations for the Corps of Engineers to determine what
changes, if any, would benefit endangered species, particularly
salmon. Evaluation beyond the reconnaissance phase is subject
to agency review and congressional notification.
The conferees direct the Corps of Engineers to undertake
the projects listed in the House report and Senate explanatory
statement and any additional projects described below for the
various continuing authorities programs. The recommended
funding levels for these programs are as follows: Section 206--
$20,000,000; Section 204--$1,500,000; Section 14--$10,000,000;

continuing authorities projects that may not be accommodated
within the funds provided for each program. It is not the
intent of the conferees that ongoing projects be terminated. If
additional funds are needed during the year to keep ongoing
work in any program on schedule, the conferees urge the Corps
of Engineers to reprogram funds into the program.
Under the Section 205 program, the conference agreement
includes $750,000 to initiate detailed plans and specifications
for the Jackson Brook Watershed, Morris County, New Jersey,
project. The conference agreement does not include funds for

agree that the work performed to date on this program by the
Corps of Engineers and the Natural Resources Conservation
Service has shown positive results in reduction of flood
damages, decreased erosion and sedimentation, and improvements
to the environment. Therefore, the conferees have agreed to
rename the program to reflect the fact that it has now gone
beyond the demonstration phase. These positive results show
that continued funding for this effort is important, and that
the entire program should be completed. This may well be a case
where the completed program gives results that are much greater
than the sum of the individual items of work. The funds
included in the bill are for the Corps of Engineers to continue
design, real estate acquisition, monitoring of completed work,
and initiation of continuing contracts. The conferees expect
the Administration to request funds for this important program
until it is completed.
The conference agreement includes $9,000,000 for
maintenance of Mississippi River levees. The funds provided
above the budget request are to be used to provide gravel
surfacing to selected locations on levee roads in Arkansas,

major lock repairs to Berwick Lock.
The conference agreement includes language proposed by
the Senate directing the Corps of Engineers to continue design
and real estate acquisition and initiate the pump supply
contract using continuing contracts for the Yazoo Basin, Yazoo
Backwater Pumping Plant, Mississippi, project. The conferees
have agreed to include $10,000,000 for this work.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, GENERAL
The conference agreement appropriates $1,940,167,000 for

conjunction with the ongoing modeling study for the Anchorage
Harbor project.
The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the
Corps of Engineers to continue the San Francisco Bay Long Term
Management Strategy, including $200,000 for the Oakland Harbor
operation and maintenance project.
The conference agreement includes an additional $250,000
each for the Cherry Creek Lake, Chatfield Lake, and Trinidad
Lake projects in Colorado. Frequent inundation of recreation
areas is causing health and safety problems that require repair
or replacement of facilities. It is not the conferees' intent
to alter the Corps of Engineers lease and property
accountability policies. It is the conferees' understanding
that the State of Colorado has agreed to cost share these
projects on a 50-50 basis. It is also the understanding of the
conferees that the Secretary of the Army will not assume, nor
share in, the future cost of the operation and maintenance of
these recreation facilities.
The conference agreement includes $750,000 for the Corps
of Engineers to plan for and enter into a continuing contract

The conferees are aware of the lead-time required to
repair and rehabilitate recreational facilities for the
upcoming Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration. Therefore,
the Corps of Engineers may, within available funds, perform
maintenance and repair of these facilities as is considered
necessary to accommodate the anticipated visitor population.
FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES
The conference agreement appropriates $15,000,000 for
Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies instead of $20,000,000 as
proposed by the House and $20,227,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees believe that stackable, modular floodwall
systems that have recently been developed could provide a
significant advantage over traditional methods of fighting
floods. One such system, which utilizes a series of inter-
connecting plastic cells to form a flood protection barrier
when filled with sand, has been successfully tested at the
Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Accordingly, the conferees expect the Corps of Engineers to
utilize funds available in the Flood Control and Coastal
Emergencies account to invest in a stackable, modular floodwall
system so that, like sandbags, the material can be stockpiled
and be available for deployment in areas of the country prone
to flooding.
REGULATORY PROGRAM
The conference agreement appropriates $139,000,000 for
the Regulatory Program instead of $134,000,000 as proposed by
the House and $144,252,000 as proposed by the Senate.
FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM
The conference agreement appropriates $145,000,000 for
the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program instead of
$150,000,000 as proposed by the House and $140,298,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conferees provide the Corps of Engineers with
reprogramming authority for FUSRAP projects of up to 15 percent
of the base of the receiving project. Reprogrammed funds must
be excess to the source project.
GENERAL EXPENSES
The conference agreement appropriates $155,151,000 for
General Expenses instead of $154,651,000 as proposed by the
House and $155,651,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes language proposed by
the House and the Senate which prohibits the use of funds to
support a congressional affairs office within the executive
office of the Chief of Engineers. This language has been
included in Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts
since fiscal year 2000. The conferees continue to believe that
an office of congressional affairs is unnecessary for the
effective management of the Civil Works program by the Corps'
headquarters, and the efficient coordination of Civil Works
issues with Members of Congress and committee staff. The
conferees are concerned that, despite the language that has
been carried in this Act, the Office of Congressional Affairs
has been involved in the exchange of Civil Works information
between the headquarters and the Congress, at times causing
delays in scheduling meetings and providing answers to
Congressional inquiries. The conferees believe that the
technical knowledge and managerial expertise needed for the
Corps' headquarters to effectively address Civil Works
authorization, appropriations, and policy matters resides in
the Civil Works organization. Therefore, the conferees direct
that the Office of Congressional Affairs not be part of the
process by which information on Civil Works projects, programs,
and activities is provided to the Congress.
In 1998, the Chief of Engineers issued a Command
Directive transferring the oversight and management of the
General Expenses account, as well as the manpower associated
with this function, from the Civil Works Directorate to the
Resource Management Office. The oversight and management of the
Civil Works program lies solely with the Directorate of Civil
Works, and it is funded through the General Expenses account to
perform those duties. Both the House and Senate Committees
expressed concern that the lack of oversight by the Director of
Civil Works over the General Expenses account could be having a
detrimental impact on the performance of the Civil Works
mission. Information recently provided by the Corps of
Engineers regarding management of the General Expenses account
has done nothing to lessen that concern. Therefore, the Corps
of Engineers is directed to adhere to the guidelines described
in the Senate explanatory statement regarding the allocation of
non-labor discretionary General Expenses funds.

reclamation and reuse in North Las Vegas, Nevada, in
cooperation with the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
The conference agreement includes $4,000,000 for the
Desalination Research and Development Program. Within the
amount provided, $3,000,000 is for construction of a national
desalination research facility to be located in the Tularosa
Basin, New Mexico. With the funds provided, the Bureau of
Reclamation shall develop and implement a coordinated research
investment strategy based on the Tularosa Basin National
Desalination Research Center feasibility study developed during
fiscal year 2002.
The conference agreement includes bill language which
provides that $10,000,000 of the funds appropriated for Water
and Related Resources shall be deposited in the San Gabriel
Basin Restoration Fund, instead of $12,000,000 as proposed by
the House.
The conference agreement does not include language
proposed by the Senate related to drought assistance.
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT RESTORATION FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $48,904,000 for the
Central Valley Project Restoration Fund as proposed by the
House and the Senate.
The conferees are in agreement with the language in the
House Report regarding the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District
Fish Screen Improvement Project and the Anadromous Fish Screen
Program.
CALIFORNIA BAY-DELTA ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION
The conference agreement includes no funds in the
California Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration account as proposed
by the House and the Senate.
The conferees have provided an additional $23,000,000
within the various units of the Central Valley Project under
the Water and Related Resources account for activities that
support the goals of the California Bay-Delta Ecosystem

The conference agreement provides $261,688,000 for
nuclear energy activities instead of $213,698,000 as proposed
by the House and $324,108,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conference agreement does not include language specifying
funding allocations as contained in the House report and Senate
explanatory statement. The conferees revised the fiscal year
2003 budget structure for Radiological Facilities Management
and Idaho Facilities Management to conform to the structure
proposed in the fiscal year 2004 budget request.
Radiological Facilities Management.--The Office of
Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology operates a variety of
facilities and equipment to support the needs of space,
defense, and medical customers who obtain radiological
materials from the Department of Energy on a reimbursable
basis.
Space and defense power systems infrastructure.--The
conference agreement includes $28,950,000 to maintain the
infrastructure necessary to support future national security
needs and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
missions. The Department is directed to provide $2,500,000 for
Neptunium-237 storage and Plutonium-238 production facilities
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Medical isotopes infrastructure.--The conference
agreement includes a total program level of $27,218,000 for the
isotope program. This amount is reduced by offsetting
collections of $6,400,000 to be received in fiscal year 2003,
resulting in a net appropriation of $20,818,000. The conference
agreement includes the request of $1,721,000 for the Isotope
Production Facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Within available funds, the Department is directed to provide
$600,000 in additional funding for the Cyclotron Isotope
Research Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The
conference agreement provides an additional $7,000,000 for
upgrades of the hot cells at the Bethel Valley Hot Cell
Complex.
The conferees recognize the potential medical value of
alpha-emitting isotopes and direct the Department to proceed
expeditiously with the project to extract thorium-229 from
excess uranium-233 stored at Oak Ridge. The Department shall
keep the Appropriations Committees fully informed at the key
decision points in the project development process to ensure
the Department is making sound business decisions on this
project.
University reactor fuel assistance and support.--The
conference agreement includes $18,500,000, an increase of
$1,000,000 over the budget request. The additional funds are
provided for the Department to fund additional regional
university reactor consortia, and the conferees strongly
encourage the Department to request sufficient funding in
future years to fund all meritorious proposals.
Research and development.--The conference agreement
provides $75,000,000 for nuclear energy research and
development activities. The conference agreement includes
$5,000,000 for nuclear energy plant optimization (NEPO),
$25,000,000 for the nuclear energy research initiative (NERI),
and $45,000,000 for nuclear energy technologies.
Within the funds provided for nuclear energy
technologies, the conferees recommend that $1,000,000 be
allocated from within the funds provided for nuclear energy
technologies for the joint DOE and NRC development of a
licensing process that would be risk-informed and technology-
neutral to support the future certification and licensing of
advanced reactor designs. The conference agreement also
provides $2,000,000 within nuclear energy technologies for the
purpose of accelerating the engineering evaluation of an
integrated sulfur/iodine thermo-chemical water-splitting cycle
for coupling with a high temperature nuclear reactor power
source. Of this $2,000,000, the conferees direct that $750,000
be provided to the Research Foundation of the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, for the purpose of establishing a public-
private partnership to develop and evaluate innovative high
temperature heat exchangers. The conference agreement also
includes $2,000,000 within nuclear energy technologies to begin
design work for a plant to demonstrate the viability of small
modular reactors.
Domestic Enrichment Capability.--The conferees note that
two private firms, the United States Enrichment Corporation and
Louisiana Energy Services, are moving forward with plans to
deploy advanced uranium enrichment technologies in the United
States. The Department is encouraged to make its expertise
available on a reimbursable basis to support these private
sector efforts. However, the interest and capability of the
private sector to address future U.S. enrichment requirements
obviates the need for the Department to pursue its own efforts
on advanced enrichment technologies. The Department should
reserve its limited research resources for those areas that are
not adequately addressed by the private sector.
Fast Flux Test Facility.--The conference agreement
transfers the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) and its associated
funding to the Non-Defense Environmental Management account.
Idaho Facilities Management.--The Department recently
reassigned the lead responsibility for the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) from the
Office of Environmental Management to the Office of Nuclear
Energy, Science and Technology. The conference agreement
provides funding for a number of infrastructure activities
under a new Idaho Facilities Management program account to
reflect the new responsibilities of the Office of Nuclear
Energy, Science and Technology for this site. The conference
agreement provides $42,770,000 for Idaho Facilities Management,
including $31,615,000 for ANL-West operations and $8,815,000
for Test Reactor Area Landlord costs. In future fiscal years,
all Idaho Landlord activities should be included within this
account.
Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative.--The conference agreement
includes $58,221,000 for spent fuel processing and advanced
fuel cycles. This amount includes $15,450,000 for EBR-II spent
fuel treatment and $2,771,000 for research and development on
pyroprocessing of sodium-bonded spent fuel, the same as the
budget request. The Department has recently proposed an
Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) that defines the future
research program for technologies to treat spent nuclear fuel
(AFCI Series One) and for advanced fuel cycles (AFCI Series
Two). The conference agreement provides $40,000,000 to support
AFCI applied research. The conferees encourage the Department
to seek active university participation in this research.
In order to ensure that the Department's AFCI can lead to
useful and practical technologies, the Office of Nuclear
Energy, Science and Technology is directed to provide Congress
with an annual AFCI Comparison Report. The report will provide
qualitative and quantitative information to enable Congress to
compare the various technology approaches to managing
commercial spent fuel. The first such report is due by May 30,
2003, and should be updated by May 30 each year thereafter so
long as the Department continues its AFCI research activity.
This report should include comparison matrices that contrast
the advantages and disadvantages of possible fuel treatment and
advanced fuel cycle technologies. The technologies should be
evaluated with respect to energy and chemical inputs, product
and waste stream outputs, proliferation considerations,
estimated R&D and facility life cycle costs (i.e., capital,
operating, and D&D, plus disposal of wastes), and the estimated
number and type of facilities required. If the Department
cannot provide specific, quantitative information (such as for
yet-to-be developed technologies), it should identify in the
matrices the estimated dates by which ongoing R&D will provide
the answers. Today's commercial light water reactor fuel cycle
and spent nuclear fuel disposition should be used as the basis
for comparison and to bound and define performance objectives
for the new technologies.
One matrix should compare spent fuel treatment
technologies, comparing advanced fast reactor systems,
accelerator systems, and other existing and proposed
reprocessing and transmutation technologies (e.g., PUREX, UREX,
UREX+) against the current once-through approach with spent
fuel from light water reactors. The second matrix should
include a similar contrast of the advantages and disadvantages
and facility requirements for advanced fuel cycles, and should
specifically address the six innovative reactor concepts that
the member countries of the Generation IV International Forum
have agreed to pursue. The second fuel cycle matrix should also
include consideration of thorium-uranium and thorium-plutonium
fuel cycles and the gas turbine modular helium reactor.
Within the funds made available for AFCI, the conference
agreement provides funding for the Department to pursue the
recommendations of the joint U.S.-Russia task force on advanced
reactor and fuel cycle technologies. The conference agreement
also includes $1,500,000 for the Idaho Accelerator Center and
$4,500,000 for AFCI-related research by the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas.
Program direction.--The conference agreement includes
$23,439,000 for program direction.
Use of prior year balances.--The conference agreement
includes the use of $6,000,000 of prior year funds to be
carried over from fiscal year 2002 to offset fiscal year 2003
requirements.
ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND HEALTH
The conference agreement provides $22,700,000 for non-
defense environment, safety and health activities, which
includes $15,860,000 for program direction.
Under the Science portion of this report, the Office of
Science is directed to submit to the House and Senate Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittees a report
providing a detailed estimate of the cost of bringing the ten
DOE Office of Science laboratories (named in House Report 107-
112) into compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
standards for nuclear safety and worker safety, respectively.
To support this task, the Department is directed to transfer
$2,500,000 to the NRC and $1,300,000 to OSHA. In addition, the
Department is directed to transfer $1,000,000 to OSHA to cover
the costs of OSHA regulation of worker health and safety at
those sites transferred to non-Federal entities and the
Department's non-nuclear facilities not covered under the
Atomic Energy Act.

budgeting and funding of safeguards and security activities,
the Department has used the cost of work for others program to
fund reimbursable safeguards and security costs incurred for
work performed for other Federal agencies. This was originally
planned to be a one-year transitional fix; however, the
Department has continued to use this procedure beyond that
time. The conferees expect the Department to submit to the
Committees on Appropriations a proposal that would allow the
direct funding of these costs within each program account in
fiscal year 2004.
Reprogramming guidelines.--The conference agreement
provides reprogramming authority of $1,000,000 or 10 percent,
whichever is less, within the Departmental Administration
account without prior submission of a reprogramming to be

the Nuclear Weapons Council certifies the Selected Acquisition
Reports, limiting the obligation of funds until the NNSA
budgets by weapons system, or providing $10,000,000 to upgrade
financial systems to track costs by weapons system. Each of
these issues is addressed further in the statement of the
managers.
Future Years Nuclear Security Program.--The conferees
agree with the House language pertaining to the inadequate
multi-year programming and budgeting information and direct the
NNSA to contract for an independent assessment of the NNSA's
planning, programming, and budgeting system, including its
comparability to that of the Department of Defense.
Strategic weapons modernization.--The conferees direct
the Secretary of Energy in conjunction with the Secretary of
Defense to provide a report to the Appropriations and Armed
Services Committees of Congress providing a specific inventory
objective for each nuclear weapon system by year and in total

Reprogramming.--The conference agreement provides limited
reprogramming authority within the Weapons Activities account
without submission of a reprogramming to be approved in advance
by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The
reprogramming thresholds will be as follows: directed stockpile
work, science campaigns, engineering campaigns, inertial
confinement fusion, advanced simulation and computing, pit
manufacturing and certification, readiness campaigns, and
operating expenses for readiness in technical base and
facilities. This should provide the needed flexibility to
manage these programs.
In addition, funding of not more than $5,000,000 may be
transferred between each of these categories and each
construction project subject to the following limitations: only
one transfer may be made to or from any program or project; the
transfer must be necessary to address a risk to health, safety
or the environment or to assure the most efficient use of
weapons activities funds at a site; and funds may not be used
for an item for which Congress has specifically denied funds or
for a new program or project that has not been authorized by
Congress.
Congressional notification within 15 days of the use of
this reprogramming authority is required. Transfers during the
fiscal year which would result in increases or decreases in
excess of $5,000,000 or which would be subject to the
limitations outlined in the previous paragraph require prior
notification and approval from the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations. Failure to notify the Committees within the
15-day period will result in denial of the reprogramming.

Sec. 301.--The conference agreement modifies a provision
proposed by the House that none of the funds may be used to
award a management and operating contract, or a contract for
environmental remediation or waste management in excess of
$100,000,000 in annual funding, or award a significant
extension or expansion to an existing management and operating
contract, unless such contract is awarded using competitive
procedures, or the Secretary of Energy grants a waiver to allow
for such a deviation.
Within 30 days of formally notifying the incumbent
contractor that the Secretary intends to grant such a waiver,
the Secretary must submit a report setting forth, in
specificity, the substantive reasons why the requirement for
competition should be waived.
This language modifies a provision carried in previous
Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 302.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate that none of the funds may be
used to prepare or implement workforce restructuring plans or
provide enhanced severance payments and other benefits and
community assistance grants for Federal employees of the
Department of Energy under section 3161 of the National Defense
Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102-484. This
provision has been carried in previous Energy and Water
Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 303.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate that none of the funds may be
used to augment the $21,183,000 made available for obligation
for severance payments and other benefits and community
assistance grants unless the Department of Energy submits a
reprogramming request subject to approval by the appropriate
Congressional committees. This provision has been carried in
previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 304.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate that none of the funds may be
used to prepare or initiate Requests for Proposals for a
program if that program has not been funded by Congress in the
current fiscal year. This provision also precludes the
Department from initiating activities for new programs which
have been proposed in the budget request, but which have not
yet been funded by Congress. This provision has been carried in
previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
TRANSFERS OF UNEXPENDED BALANCES
Sec. 305.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate that permits the transfer and
merger of unexpended balances of prior appropriations with
appropriation accounts established in this bill. This provision
has been carried in previous Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 306.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House prohibiting the Bonneville Power
Administration from performing energy efficiency services
outside the legally defined Bonneville service territory unless
the Administrator certifies in advance that such services are
not available from private sector businesses. This provision
has been carried in previous Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 307.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House establishing certain notice and
competition requirements for Department of Energy user
facilities. This provision has been carried in previous Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 308.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate allowing the Administrator of
the National Nuclear Security Administration to authorize
certain nuclear weapons production plants to use not more than
2 percent of available funds for research, development and
demonstration activities. This provision has been carried in
previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 309.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House and Senate allowing the Administrator of
the National Nuclear Security Administration to authorize the
manager of the Nevada Operations Office to use not more than 2
percent of available funds for research, development and
demonstration activities necessary for operations and readiness
of the Nevada Test Site.
Sec. 310.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House that would repeal section 310 of Public
Law 106-60, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Act, 2000, which required submission of funding plans from
Department of Energy laboratories.
Sec. 311.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the House which would authorize intelligence
activities of the Department of Energy for purposes of section
504 of the National Security Act of 1947 until enactment of the
Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2003.
Sec. 312.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the Senate limiting the types of waste that can be
disposed of in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.
None of the funds may be used to dispose of transuranic waste
in excess of 20 percent plutonium by weight for the aggregate
of any material category. At the Rocky Flats site, this
provision includes ash residues; salt residues; wet residues;
direct repackage residues; and scrub alloy as referenced in the
``Final Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Certain
Plutonium Residues and Scrub Alloy Stored at the Rocky Flats
Environmental Technology Site''. This provision has been
carried in previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Acts.
Sec. 313.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the Senate providing that funds appropriated in
Public Law 107-66 for the Kachemak Bay submarine cable project
may be available to reimburse the local sponsor for the Federal
share of the project costs assumed by the local sponsor prior
to final passage of that Act.
Sec. 314.--The conference agreement includes a provision
proposed by the Senate requiring that upon the request of the
licensee for FERC License No. 11393, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission shall issue an order staying the license.
Sec. 315.--The conference agreement modifies a provision
proposed by the Senate providing that none of the funds for
Department of Energy environmental management activities may be
obligated at a Department of Energy site or laboratory in
excess of the current-year level of funding or the fiscal year
2003 budget request, whichever is greater, unless the site or
laboratory has entered into a site performance management plan
consistent with the intent of the Department's environmental
management acceleration and reform initiative.
Sec. 316.--The conference agreement modifies a provision
proposed by the Senate prohibiting the National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) from taking any actions
adversely affecting employment at its Nevada Operations Office
for a period of not less than 365 days. The conference
agreement includes a provision allowing the Administrator of
the NNSA to seek a waiver from this requirement. Similar to a
reprogramming action, written approval must be received from
the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittees.
Sec. 317.--The conference agreement includes a provision
providing that notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
Secretary of Energy shall proceed with planning and analyses
for external regulation of the Department's laboratories under
the Office of Science.
Provisions not adopted by the conference.--The conference
agreement deletes language proposed by the Senate that:
requires the General Accounting Office to conduct a study of
the effectiveness of the benefit program under subtitle D of
the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program
Act of 2000; requires the General Accounting Office to conduct
a study of the cleanup progress at the Paducah Gaseous
Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky; and prohibits the use of
funds in this or any other Act to withdraw from availability or
otherwise adversely affect the planned expenditure of funds
previously made available for Cerro Grande Fire activities.--
These requirements are addressed in the statement of the
managers.
Language proposed by the Senate allowing the Secretary of
Interior to participate in the CALFED Bay-Delta Authority has
been modified and moved to Title II.
CONFERENCE RECOMMENDATIONS
The conference agreement's detailed funding
recommendations for programs in title III are contained in the
following table.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
TITLE IV
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
The conference agreement includes $71,290,000 for the
Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) as proposed by the House
instead of $74,400,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
support the Appalachian-Turkish Trade Project to promote trade
and investment opportunities. From within available funds,
$5,000,000 has been provided for a child development research
center at the University of Alabama and $8,000,000 for the
newly authorized telecommunications program within the ARC. The
conferees are aware of the Intermodal Industrial Park project
in Wellsville, Ohio, and urge the ARC to help the Columbiana
County Port Authority complete the project.
DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD
The conference agreement includes $19,000,000 for the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board as proposed by the
House and Senate.
DELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY
The conference agreement includes $8,000,000 for the
Delta Regional Authority instead of $15,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate and no funding as proposed by the House. The
conferees expect the Authority to submit to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations quarterly financial reports
providing detailed accounting data on the expenditure of funds
during fiscal year 2003 and thereafter. The conferees also
expect to receive from the Authority a detailed budget
justification in fiscal year 2004. The Authority failed to
comply with this requirement in fiscal year 2003.
DENALI COMMISSION
The conference agreement includes $48,000,000 for the
Denali Commission instead of $50,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate and no funding as proposed by the House. The conferees
expect the Denali Commission to submit to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations quarterly financial reports
providing detailed accounting data on the expenditure of funds
during fiscal year 2003 and thereafter. The conferees also
expect to receive from the Commission a detailed budget
justification in fiscal year 2004.
NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $578,184,000 as
proposed by the House and the Senate, to be offset by revenues
of $520,087,000, for a net appropriation of $58,097,000. This
reflects the statutory language adopted by the conference in
fiscal year 2001 to reduce the fee recovery requirement to 94
percent in fiscal year 2003. The conference amount provides the
same total amount as the budget request, including the
$29,300,000 requested for security expenses, but applies the
fee recovery requirement to this increment of funding.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The conference agreement includes $6,800,000 as proposed
by the House and Senate, to be offset by revenues of
$6,392,000, for a net appropriation of $408,000. This reflects
the statutory language adopted by the conference in fiscal year
2001 to reduce the fee recovery requirement to 94 percent in
fiscal year 2003.
NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $3,200,000, the same as
the budget request.
TITLE V
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 501.--The conference agreement includes language
directing that none of the funds in this Act or any prior
appropriations Act may be used in any way, directly or
indirectly, to influence congressional action on any
legislation or appropriation matters pending before Congress,
other than to communicate to Members of Congress as described
in section 1913 of title 18, United States Code. This provision
has been carried in previous Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 502.--The conference agreement includes language
regarding the purchase of American-made equipment and products,
and prohibiting contracts with persons falsely labeling
products as made in America. This provision has been carried in
previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations Acts.
Sec. 503.--The conference agreement includes language
proposed by the House providing that none of the funds made
available in this Act may be transferred to any department,
agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government,
except pursuant to transfer made by, or transfer authority
provided in, this Act or any other appropriation Act.
Sec. 504.--The conference agreement includes language
proposed by the Senate that extends the existing authority for
the Denali Commission until 2008.
Sec. 505.--The conference agreement includes language
proposed by the Senate that amends section 503 of the Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2002, by extending
the prohibition of oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes
until 2005.
Sec. 506.--The conference agreement includes a provision
clarifying that the Department of Energy's discretionary
indemnification authority will protect communities, lenders,
and subsequent owners of former Department of Energy property
to the same extent that communities impacted by base closures
are protected.
Sec. 507.--The conference agreement includes a provision
directing the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
to transmit to Congress by April 1, 2003, a cross-cut budget
displaying, by fiscal year, all CALFED Bay-Delta Program
related expenditures by the Federal government for fiscal years
1996 through 2004.
Provisions not adopted.--The conference agreement deletes
language proposed by the House prohibiting obligation of funds
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant any public
utility the authority to use market-based rates until the
Commission has issued a final order in all market-based rate
cases that have been pending before the Commission for more
than 18 months.

The total new budget (obligational) authority for the
fiscal year 2003 recommended by the Committee of Conference,
with comparisons to the fiscal year 2002 amount, the 2003
budget estimates, and the House and Senate bills for 2003

DIVISION E
FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED
PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS, 2003
In determining Congressional intent for the obligation
and programming of funds for fiscal year 2003, the appropriate
departments and agencies funded under this Act shall rely on
House Report 107-663, the Senate report as printed in the
Congressional Record of January 15, 2003, and the statement of
the managers. Any ambiguity shall be resolved by consulting
with the Committees on Appropriations.
TITLE I--EXPORT AND INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE
Export-Import Bank of the United States
The conference agreement appropriates $512,900,000 for
the subsidy appropriation for the Export-Import Bank.
The managers are aware of an inter-agency agreement among
the Departments of State and Defense, the Export-Import Bank,
and USAID that establishes reporting procedures regarding
compliance with section 512 of the Act, the so-called Brooke
amendment, and section 620(q) of the Foreign Assistance Act.
The procedures provide a mechanism to share information among
those agencies regarding countries that are either in arrears
on loan repayments owed the United States or which may soon
become in arrears. Since the provision of foreign assistance to
countries in arrears is restricted by those sections,
information required by these procedures is of great importance
to the administration of foreign assistance funds. The managers
are therefore concerned about reports that the Export-Import
Bank has, in at least two instances this year, failed to
provide information on arrearages in a timely fashion in
accordance with its obligations under the inter-agency
agreement. The managers direct the Export-Import Bank to follow
the inter-agency agreement and not allow a similar lapse to
occur again.
The managers endorse House report language regarding the
Export-Import Bank with respect to the domestic steel market,
reducing global excess steel making capacity, and subsequent
reporting to the Committees on Appropriations.
Overseas Private Investment Corporation
The managers direct the President of OPIC to continue
current policy and consult with the Committees on
Appropriations before any future financing for non-governmental
organizations or private and voluntary organizations is
approved.
The managers are concerned with a number of OPIC projects
involving the shrimp industry in Southeast Asia. The managers
expect OPIC to consult with the appropriate Congressional
committees on this issue.
FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT
Trade and Development Agency
The conference agreement appropriates $47,012,000 for the
Trade and Development Agency (TDA) instead of $49,512,000 as
proposed by the House and $44,696,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The level of funding includes an additional $2,500,000
for trade capacity building assistance instead of $5,000,000 as
proposed by the House. The Senate did not address the issue of
trade capacity building assistance.
TITLE II--BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
Frequency of Executive Branch Reports on Country Allocations
The managers insist that the Department of State and the
United States Agency for International Development comply with
the provisions of section 653 of the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, as amended, regarding the frequency of notifications
regarding the allocation of foreign assistance. Enactment of
any supplemental appropriations act for foreign assistance
requires an additional notification under section 653. When
feasible, the Department of State is expected to include
amounts from the Migration and Refugee Assistance and Emergency
Refugee and Migration Assistance accounts. USAID is expected to
include International Disaster Assistance and Transition
Initiatives amounts for each country.
In addition, the Department of State and USAID are
requested to provide comparable information on regional and
centrally-administered programs, and to consult in advance with
the relevant committees of Congress regarding reductions in
excess of $20,000,000 or ten percent of previously reported
amounts for a foreign country, international organization, or
regional program.
Compliance with Report Language
The managers note that at times in the past, the
Department of State and USAID have failed to respond to
recommendations in the House and Senate Appropriations
Committee reports, choosing instead to recognize only language
in the statement of the managers accompanying the conference
report. The managers expect the Department of State and USAID
to follow the recommendations in the House and Senate reports,
unless those recommendations are modified in the statement of
the managers. In the event that the House and Senate
Appropriations Committee reports contain conflicting
recommendations on the same subject, the managers expect the
Department of State, USAID, and other appropriate agencies to
consult with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
regarding those recommendations.
United States Agency for International Development
CHILD SURVIVAL AND HEALTH PROGRAMS FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $1,836,500,000 for
the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund instead of
$1,710,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,970,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes language allocating
$1,836,500,000 among seven program categories in the Child
Survival and Health Programs Fund: $324,000,000 for child
survival and maternal health, including vaccine-preventable
diseases such as polio; $27,000,000 for vulnerable children;
$591,500,000 for HIV/AIDS; $155,500,000 for other infectious
diseases; $368,500,000 for reproductive health/family planning;
$120,000,000 for UNICEF; and $250,000,000 for the Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global ATM Fund). The
Committee expects that any change proposed subsequent to the
allocation as directed in bill language will be subject to the
requirements of section 515 of the Act. A definition of program
categories and their components can be found on pages 9 through
11 of House Report 107-142 and under the heading ``Family
Planning/Reproductive Health'' on page 12 of Senate Report 107-
58.
The conference agreement provides not less than
$800,000,000 for assistance to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. Of
this amount, $591,500,000 is funded through the Child Survival
and Health Programs Fund. Another $38,500,000 is provided
through other USAID-managed or co-managed accounts, such as the
Economic Support Fund, International Disaster Assistance, and
regional accounts for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. The remaining $170,000,000 is a conservative estimate of
the amount from the Foreign Operations division of this Act
that will be allocated for HIV/AIDS by the Global ATM Fund and
UN agencies. The estimate of $800,000,000 for AIDS does not
include the United States share of HIV/AIDS assistance through
the World Bank Group.
The managers are concerned about the growing prevalence
of HIV/AIDS in countries of Eastern Europe and the Independent
States of the Former Soviet Union. The managers therefore
direct that funds from the Child Survival and Health Programs
Fund be available for HIV/AIDS programs in Eastern Europe and
the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union. The managers
also encourage USAID to make available funds from this account
for HIV/AIDS programs in ``ESF countries'' other than those for
whom funds are specifically mandated in this Act.
The conference agreement also provides a total of
$155,500,000 from the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund
to combat infectious diseases other than HIV/AIDS, such as
malaria and tuberculosis.
In addition, the conference agreement includes
$250,000,000 as a contribution to the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, bringing the total United
States contribution to the fund to date to $725,000,000. The
managers note that the President's request for the Global ATM
Fund from Division E of this Act is $100,000,000. The timing of
disbursement of the full $725,000,000 is limited by language
requiring that the United States contribution may not exceed
the total resources provided by other donors and available for
use by the Global Fund. The managers note also that, of the
awards pledged thus far by the Global ATM Fund to recipient
countries, approximately 65 percent are for AIDS interventions,
17 percent are for malaria interventions, and 16 percent are
for tuberculosis or combined tuberculosis/AIDS interventions.
When funding through bilateral programs administered by
USAID is considered together with the United States
contribution to the Global ATM Fund, the conference agreement
provides a total of $120,000,000 for tuberculosis assistance.
Of this amount, $65,000,000 is funded through the Child
Survival and Health Programs account, $15,000,000 from other
bilateral accounts, and $40,000,000 through the contribution to
the Global Fund. For malaria, the conference agreement provides
a total of $115,000,000. Of this amount, it is expected that
$42,500,000 of the contribution to the Global Fund will fund
malaria programs, $65,000,000 is funded through this account,
and $7,500,000 is provided from other bilateral accounts.
The conference agreement includes bill language, proposed
by the Senate, regarding the development of microbicides as a
means of combating HIV/AIDS.
In addition, the conference agreement includes up to
$100,000,000 for mother and child HIV prevention and up to
$10,500,000 for a United States contribution to the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
The managers are concerned that little progress has been
made toward the implementation of the micronutrient programs
mandated by Section 3013 of P.L. 107-171 and direct USAID to
implement this provision as soon as possible this fiscal year.
The managers support $27,500,000 for the multilateral
effort to eradicae polio in fiscal year 2003, instead of
$30,000,000 as recommended in the Senate report and $25,000,000
as recommended in the House report.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding
malaria, and recommend that USAID provide direct support to the
Medicines for Malaria Venture and the Malaria Vaccine
Initiative.
The conference agreement allocates $368,500,000 for
family planning/reproductive health within the Child Survival
and Health Programs Fund, as proposed by the House, instead of
$385,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Section 522 of the
conference agreement mandates that an overall total of
$446,500,000 be made available for bilateral family planning/
reproductive health from this account, the Economic Support
Fund, and the regional accounts for Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, as in current law.
The managers endorse the language of the House report
with respect to the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation Congolese
Hospital, Lott Carey International, and the Caribbean
Epidemiology Center.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding
programs for people with disabilities, including
recommendations to provide funding for Special Olympics'
overseas programs and for Olympic Aid.
The managers also direct USAID to continue to provide the
Committees with a detailed annual report not later than March
31, 2003, on the programs, projects, and activities undertaken
by the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund during fiscal
year 2002.
Funds appropriated for the Child Survival and Health
Programs Fund are appropriated for programs, projects and
activities. Funds for administrative expenses to manage Fund
activities are provided in a separate account, with two
exceptions included in the conference agreement: authority for
USAID's central and regional bureaus to use up to $150,000 from
program funds for Operating Expense-funded personnel to better
monitor and provide oversight of the Fund; and, in section 522,
authority to use up to $13,500,000 to reimburse other
government agencies and private institutions for professional
services.
The managers are aware that significant USAID resources
are directed toward support for the Global ATM Fund, both at
its Geneva headquarters and in developing countries seeking or
in receipt of Fund rewards. The managers have no objection to
such support, but request a brief written report not later than
March 15, 2003 on the extent and cost of such support,
including the cost of non-USAID direct hire staff involved in
such efforts. In addition, any proposed transfer of
appropriations from the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund
to the Department of Health and Human Services is limited to
$25,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, and such transfer, as well as
any transfer to USAID Operating Expenses, under any authority
other than this Act shall be subject to section 515 of this
Act.
Any proposed obligations for Global Development Alliance
programs, projects or activities shall be subject to the
regular notification procedures of the Committees on
Appropriations.
Development Assistance
The conference agreement appropriates $1,389,000,000 for
``Development Assistance'' instead of $1,398,000,000 as
proposed by the House and $1,365,500,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The managers have agreed to provide $218,000,000 for
basic education, including adult literacy programs, under the
development assistance account, as proposed by the House bill,
instead of $200,000,000 as proposed by the Senate amendment. In
addition, $32,000,000 should be derived from other accounts.
The managers endorse the language of the House report with
regard to Alfalit International.
The conference agreement includes a provision, similar to
a Senate amendment, which provides that $100,000,000 shall be
made available for drinking water supply projects and related
activities. The managers request that USAID report within 90
days of enactment of this Act on plans for the disbursement of
these funds.
The conference agreement provides that, of the funds for
agriculture and rural development programs, $25,000,000 should
be provided for plant biotechnology research and development.
The managers support programs that conserve energy and
promote efficient energy production and distribution in
developing countries. The conference agreement provides in
section 555 that $175,000,000 should be made available for
these programs. The conference agreement does not include a
Senate earmark of $13,000,000 for USAID's Office of Energy and
Information Technology. However, the managers are concerned
that USAID is not devoting sufficient resources to promoting
renewable, clean and efficient energy technologies, of which
the United States is the leading manufacturer. The managers are
also concerned that funding for USAID's Office of Energy and
Information Technology has declined, and that it does not have
the staff to adequately address the energy challenges and
opportunities in developing countries with rapidly growing
populations. The managers recommend additional funding and
enhanced staffing for this office in fiscal year 2003.
The managers endorse both the House report and Senate
report language on the Institute for Liberty and Democracy
(ILD), and strongly recommend that not less than $6,000,000 be
made available for the ILD in fiscal year 2003. The managers
also endorse the language of the House report with respect to
the Education for Development and Democracy Initiative (EEDI),
and women's inheritance rights in Africa.
The managers direct that not less than $500,000 be made
available for the United States Telecommunications Training
Institute, a long-standing and successful program that provides
communications and broadcasting training to professionals
around the world. The Senate amendment included bill language
mandating that such funds be made available for this purpose.
The House bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement provides that $18,000,000 should
be made available for the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad
program. The Senate amendment included bill language stating
that $19,000,000 should be made available for this purpose.
The conference agreement in section 554 includes language
directing that USAID should make available $145,000,000 for
programs and activities that directly protect biodiversity. The
managers strongly support these efforts and expect these funds
to be used to protect tropical forests, including support of
projects to deter illegal logging in Indonesia, Central Africa
and elsewhere, and other threatened biologically diverse areas,
both terrestrial and marine. Of this amount, up to $40,000,000
may be available for the subsidy cost of modifying loans and
loan guarantees, pursuant to the provisions of the Tropical
Forest Conservation Act of 1998. The managers commend the
Administration for its Congo Basin Forest Initiative and expect
full funding to be made available for the Central African
Regional Program for the Environment.
The managers note the Committees' history of commitment
to USAID's Office of Women in Development. The managers
conclude that the office is currently an underutilized resource
at the Agency, and are disappointed with the lack of commitment
the Agency has shown to it. The managers are also disappointed
that USAID over many years has consistently failed to fully
comply with Congressional direction to provide the WID office
with adequate financial resources and skilled personnel.
The managers are aware of the ways in which development
challenges affect men and women differently. For instance, in
recent years, there has been widespread recognition of the
importance of investments in educating girls and the unique
obstacles to educating girls in developing societies. The
managers expect that much of the work on these issues, as well
as the funding for these types of interventions, should be
derived from bureau and mission program funds. An example of
bureau and mission funded activities would be women's
leadership training programs, on behalf of which the managers
endorse the language and report requirement included in the
House report.
The managers urge USAID to increase the capacity of the
Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination, in collaboration
with the WID office, to provide agency-wide leadership to
integrate concerns of women in development strategies, an
especially important function as USAID devises new agriculture
and trade strategies. The WID office should have the budget,
appropriately skilled personnel, and flexibility to consult
with overseas missions on country programs, determine the need
for better women's integration strategies in each of the
functional and regional bureaus and country and regional
missions, provide technical assistance in strategic planning as
necessary, and offer incentive funds to missions to undertake
new gender integration initiatives. The managers remain
concerned about the ability of the WID office to have agency-
wide impact from its current location within the Bureau for
Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, and urge the Agency to
take all possible steps to alleviate these concerns. The
managers direct the Administrator to report to the Committees
on Appropriations no later than 120 days after the enactment of
this Act on steps taken to address these concerns and
recommendations.
The managers strongly support the fertilizer-related
research and development being conducted by the International
Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) and urge USAID to make at
least $4,000,000 available to IFDC, including not less than
$2,300,000 for its core grant, as provided under the Senate
amendment and in the House report.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
that USAID should fund programs to provide alternative
livelihoods for Vietnamese coffee growers. The managers are
deeply concerned with the situation that confronts impoverished
Vietnamese coffee farmers, and have been informed that USAID is
already engaged in these types of activities. The managers urge
USAID to expand these activities and other job-creation efforts
in Vietnam. Additionally, the managers endorse the Senate
report language on the coffee crisis. The managers also endorse
Senate report language regarding Laos.
The managers endorse House report language directing the
Secretary of State to initiate discussions with Mexico
regarding the Revillagigedo Islands.
International Disaster Assistance
The conference agreement appropriates $290,000,000 for
``International Disaster Assistance'' as proposed by the
Senate, instead of $315,500,000 as proposed by the House. Of
this amount, not less than $60,000,000 above the request is
appropriated only for Afghanistan, and an additional
$25,000,000 is expected to be made available for Afghanistan.
The director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance is to
consult with the Committees not less than every three months,
on the current status of commitments, obligations, and
expenditures by the Office and on any proposals to augment
``International Disaster Assistance'' by transfers from other
accounts.
Transition Initiatives
The conference agreement appropriates $50,000,000 for
``Transition Initiatives'' to support USAID's Office of
Transition Initiatives (OTI). The House bill proposed
$40,000,000 and the Senate amendment $55,000,000 for this
account.
Development Credit Authority
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement does not include a Senate
earmark of $4,000,000 to support urban programs. However, the
managers note the rapid population growth and increasing
poverty in cities in developing countries and urge USAID to
expand its use of the Development Credit Authority to address
these growing urban needs.
Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for International
Development
The conference agreement provides $572,000,000 for
Operating Expenses of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, instead of $572,200,000 as proposed by the House
and $571,087,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The managers note that events since September 11, 2001
have imposed increasing administrative costs on the programs of
the U.S. Agency for International Development. In particular,
these costs have been felt in the Middle East and Asia. The
managers are concerned that USAID have sufficient operating
expenses resources to assure the safety of its employees and
their families in an increasingly dangerous environment. The
managers, therefore, request that USAID submit within 90 days
of enactment of this Act a report detailing these increased
costs agency-wide, with particular emphasis on the Asia/Near
East region. This report should include, but not be limited to,
an analysis of how the Agency is using operating expenses and
how operating expense costs have increased since fiscal year
2001.
The managers endorse the language of the House report
with respect to the USAIDLINK program.
Capital Investment Fund
The conference agreement appropriates $43,000,000 as
proposed by the House instead of $65,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement includes House language that
authorizes the Administrator of USAID to assess fair and
reasonable rental payments for the use of space by employees of
other government agencies; provides that the rental payments
shall be deposited into this account as offsetting collections;
requires notification for the use of such offsetting
collections, as well as for funds appropriated under this
heading; and provides that the assignment of United States
Government employees and contractors to space in buildings
shall be subject to the concurrence of the Administrator of
USAID.
The conference agreement assumes $30,000,000 for a new
USAID building in Nairobi, as requested by the President.
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that of the Senate amendment that authorizes up to $10,000,000
for the costs of temporary, secure facilities in Afghanistan.
The managers endorse the Senate report language regarding this
matter. The conference report does not contain Senate language
that provided not less than $13,000,000 for information
technology and related capital investments. The House bill did
not address these matters.
Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for International
Development
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The conference agreement appropriates $33,300,000 for
Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for
International Development, Office of Inspector General, instead
of $33,046,000 as proposed by the Senate and $33,700,000 as
proposed by the House. The managers encourage the Inspector
General to continue the policy of constructive and ongoing
reviews of USAID's attempts to resolve its serious financial
and human resource management and procurement challenges. The
managers also request the Inspector General to inform the
Committee promptly of any emerging deficiencies.
Other Bilateral Economic Assistance
ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $2,270,000,000 for
the Economic Support Fund instead of $2,445,000,000 as proposed
by the House and $2,260,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
providing for the early disbursement of funds for Israel within
30 days of enactment. The House bill included this language,
along with language that provided for disbursement by October
31, 2002, whichever was later.
The conference agreement does not include House language
providing for $200,000,000 in anti-terrorism assistance for
Israel. The Senate amendment did not address this matter.
The conference agreement includes language that provides
not less than $200,000,000 for the Commodity Import Program in
Egypt as proposed by the Senate. The House bill did not address
this matter.
The managers recognize that Egypt is a vital and
strategic ally of the United States and plays an important role
in the Middle East peace process. However, they remain
concerned about the human rights situation in Egypt, especially
restrictions on freedom of expression and the promotion of
inflammatory speech by government-controlled media, as well as
impediments to the development of democracy and the rule of
law.
The conference agreement does not include language from
the House bill that provided that not less than $45,000,000
should be made available for Afghanistan for a variety of
purposes. The Senate amendment did not address this matter
under this heading. This matter is addressed under section 523
of the conference report.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
providing that $5,000,000, in addition to funds previously
allocated, should be made available for programs that bring
together Arabs and Israelis, including three specified
organizations. The House bill did not address this matter.
However, the managers reiterate strong support for important
conflict resolution programs in the Middle East as described in
the House report and the Senate bill and report, including
Seeds of Peace, the Arava Institute, Jerusalem International
YMCA, Interns for Peace, and the CONTACT program, and expect
the allocation of up to $5,000,000 for these and similar
programs.
The managers endorse the House report language regarding
support for the International Arid Lands Consortium. In
addition, the managers endorse the House report language
regarding the Blaustein Institute for Desert Research. The
managers also endorse the House and Senate report language on
the International Crisis Group and the Foundation for
Environmental Security and Sustainability.
The conference agreement also includes language that
provides that not less than $250,000,000 should be made
available for assistance for Jordan. The Senate language would
have mandated this level of support. The House bill did not
address this matter.
The conference agreement does not contain Senate language
providing that not less than $75,000,000 should be provided for
the West Bank and Gaza. However, it includes language similar
to that in the Senate amendment authorizing up to $1,000,000
for further legal reforms, including judicial training on
commercial disputes and ethics. The managers request that USAID
consult with the Committees on Appropriations on plans for the
disbursement of funds.
The managers also endorse the House report language in
support of a joint proposal of Al Quds University and the Kuvin
Center for Infectious and Tropical Diseases of the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem to establish a cooperative project in
health and infectious diseases for the West Bank and Gaza.
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that in the Senate that provides that not less $15,000,000
shall be available for assistance for Cyprus. The House bill
had similar language, but it provided that $15,000,000 should
be made available rather than making this level mandatory.
The conference report includes language similar to that
in the Senate amendment that provides not less than $35,000,000
for assistance for Lebanon. The House bill included language
that recommended this level of assistance for Lebanon, but did
not include Senate language regarding child custody and
international pickup orders. In addition, funding provided in
this account for the Central Government of Lebanon is subject
to Congressional notification. The Senate amendment would have
prohibited assistance for the central government. The managers
direct that funding for American educational institutions in
Lebanon from the bilateral assistance program be provided in
fiscal year 2003 at no less than the fiscal year 2002 level of
$3,500,000.
The managers remain concerned with the failure of the
Government of Lebanon, despite repeated requests at the highest
levels, to enforce the orders of Lebanese courts requiring the
return of abducted American children in Lebanon. The conference
agreement provides that the Government of Lebanon should
enforce the custody and international pickup orders, issued
during calendar year 2001, of Lebanon's civil courts regarding
abducted American children in Lebanon.
The conference agreement provides not less than
$60,000,000 under this heading for USAID programs in Indonesia.
The Senate amendment had included $150,000,000 for Indonesia
from all accounts in the Act, including $10,000,000 for
programs in Aceh and not less than $5,000,000 for
reconstruction and recovery efforts in Bali. The House did not
address this matter. The managers recommend $10,000,000 for
reconciliation and development programs in Aceh, and $5,000,000
for reconstruction and recovery efforts in Bali.
The managers are outraged by continued reports of the
complicity of local Indonesian military units in the murders of
Americans Ted Burgon and Rick Spier in Papua last year, and
call upon President Megawati Sukarnoputri to use the full
authority of her office to bring to justice the perpetrators of
this crime.
The managers expect USAID to adequately fund programs and
activities relating to parliamentary and presidential elections
scheduled in 2004. In addition, the managers recommend
continued funding for activities targeted toward the
professional development of provincial leaders and
institutions. The conference agreement does not include Senate
language prohibiting the use of funds made available for Aceh
to construct roads or other infrastructure that threatens the
habitat of orangutans or other endangered species. However, the
managers are concerned that plans to construct a network of
roads and other infrastructure in the remaining forest habitat
of orangutans and other endangered species in Aceh could
rapidly doom these animals to extinction. No U.S. assistance is
to be used for such activities.
The conference agreement also includes Senate language
that provides that not less than $25,000,000 shall be made
available for Timor-Leste, including up to $1,000,000, which
may be transferred to and merged with Operating Expenses of the
United States Agency for International Development. The House
bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that in the Senate amendment that recommends that $2,000,000
should be made available for assistance for countries to
implement and enforce the Kimberley Process Implementation
Scheme (KPIS). The Senate amendment would have provided
$3,500,000 for this purpose. The House bill did not address
this matter. The managers support the KPIS, an international
regime aimed at stopping the trade in ``conflict diamonds'',
and urge the diamond industry and non-governmental
organizations to provide financial assistance and expertise to
help implement KPIS. The managers endorse the Senate report
language on this issue.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
regarding human rights programs in North Korea. This matter is
addressed under section 526.
The conference agreement contains language similar to
that in the Senate amendment that provides $3,000,000 for
international youth exchanges for secondary school students
from countries with significant Muslim populations. The House
bill did not address this matter. The managers note that the
allocation of these funds will fulfill a one-year, one-time
commitment to fund this program within the foreign operations
budget, absent a formal budget request in the future.
The conference agreement does not contain Senate language
regarding support for the provision of wheelchairs for needy
persons in developing countries. This matter is addressed under
``Child Survival and Health Programs Fund''.
The conference agreement contains language similar to
that of the Senate amendment that provides that not less than
$10,000,000 should be made available in fiscal year 2003 for a
contribution to the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The Senate
amendment would have mandated this level of assistance. The
House bill did not address this matter. The managers strongly
support the efforts of the Court and the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to hold accountable those involved in
the atrocities committed during the conflict. The managers
continue to be disappointed that the State Department, during
fiscal year 2002, ignored the managers' recommendation to
accelerate the disbursement of United States funding for the
Court to meet pressing transportation, security, and other
needs. The managers expect $10,000,000 to be disbursed in
fiscal year 2003, and understand that these funds would fulfill
a three-year U.S. pledge of assistance for the court.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
authorizing the use of not to exceed $200,000,000 for debt
restructuring for Pakistan, and not to exceed $15,000,000 of
funds appropriated under this heading in Public Law 107-296 for
debt restructuring for Jordan. The House bill did not address
these matters.
International Fund for Ireland
The conference agreement appropriates $25,000,000 as
proposed by the House. The Senate amendment contained no
provision on this matter.
Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States
The conference agreement appropriates $525,000,000,
instead of $520,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$530,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that from the House bill that provides that $5,000,000 shall be
made available for assistance for the Baltic States. The House
bill did not mandate this level of assistance. The Senate
amendment did not address this matter.
The conference agreement contains language that provides
that up to $1,000,000 should be made available for training
programs for Kosovar women. The Senate amendment would have
mandated $2,000,000 for such programs. The House bill did not
address this matter. The managers expect sufficient funding
will be provided for reconstruction, reform, and reconciliation
efforts in Kosovo. They also endorse the funding level for
Serbia as recommended in the Senate report.
The conference agreement contains language that provides
that $2,000,000 should be made available to enhance safety at
nuclear power plants. It is intended that this nuclear safety
program will entail the provision of full scope simulators. The
Senate amendment would have mandated $5,000,000 for this
purpose. The House bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
providing $750,000 to support regional programs and activities
to promote reconciliation among ethnic groups within the former
Yugoslavia. However, the managers recommend that USAID consider
funding for such programs that are conducted by local
nongovernmental organizations.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
regarding the authority of the President to withhold certain
assistance for Bosnia if it has not complied with certain
requirements of the Dayton Accord on the withdrawal of foreign
forces, and has not terminated intelligence cooperation with
state sponsors of terrorism and terrorist organizations. The
House bill had similar language, but included a reference to
cooperation with Iranian officials rather than state sponsors
of terrorism and terrorist organizations.
The managers strongly support the funding level for
Montenegro as recommended in the House report.
The managers recommend up to a total of $5,000,000 for
the Russian, Eurasian, and East European Research and Training
Program (Title VIII). The managers also endorse House report
language in support of the East Central European Scholarship
Program (ECESP).
Assistance for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union
The conference agreement appropriates $760,000,000,
instead of $755,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$765,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes not less than
$60,000,000 for child survival, environmental and other health
activities, and programs to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, including
$15,000,000 for reproductive health/family planning. The
managers direct the Coordinator and USAID to utilize the higher
level of health funding to expand primary and advanced health
programs in Central Asia, with an emphasis on reducing the
incidence of tuberculosis in the region, including
consideration of proposals to establish telemedicine
partnerships between United States medical institutions and
counterparts in Central Asia. The manager also endorse House
and Senate report language regarding the Primary Healthcare
Initiative and strongly recommend that not less than $2,500,000
be made available for this program to help it to become self-
sustaining.
The managers strongly support regional cooperation
efforts among the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
Georgia. To further regional cooperation, the conference
agreement continues the current six exemptions from the
statutory restrictions on assistance to the Government of
Azerbaijan. The managers include a provision that funds
available for the Southern Caucasus may be used for confidence-
building measures and other activities related to the
resolution of regional conflicts, notwithstanding any other
provision of law, as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes not less than
$90,000,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of $83,433,000 as
proposed by the House, for assistance for Armenia under the
heading ``Assistance for the Independent States of the Former
Soviet Union''.
The managers strongly encourage the State Department to
continue discussions with the sponsors of the proposed CANDEL
project and relevant Armenian authorities on the economic
viability and sustainability of the project. The managers
recommend that continued funding for the project's study be
made available from assistance provided for Armenia in this
Act.
The managers have not included a specific amount for
Georgia in the conference agreement, as proposed by both the
Senate and the House, but continue to support the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Georgia, and expect that the
request for Georgia will be made available by the
Administration. The managers encourage the Government of
Georgia to take more effective measures to defend human rights
and the rule of law by protecting religious minorities against
mob violence. The incidence of suchattacks without intervention
by police or other security forces is of great concern to the
Committees on Appropriations.
The managers commend USAID for its thorough review and
consideration of the establishment of an Absorptive Capacity
Fund (ACF) for Georgia. Given shifting priorities in that
country, the managers rescind their directives in the
Conference Report accompanying H.R. 4811 relating to the ACF.
The managers continue to be concerned with the murder of
John Alvis, a democracy worker with the International
Republican Institute, in Azerbaijan. The managers request that
within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the State Department
provide an update on the status of the investigation. The
managers expect the State Department and relevant Azeri
authorities to continue to make this investigation a top
priority.
The managers endorse both Senate and House language
relating to Ukraine, and reiterate concerns about violence
against members of the Rada and with the reports concerning
Ukraine's covert transfer of the Kulchuga radar system to Iraq.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$20,000,000 should be made available for nuclear reactor safety
initiatives in Ukraine, of which $12,000,000 should be for
simulator-related projects, and not less than $1,500,000 for
coal mine safety programs. This is similar to a Senate
amendment. The House did not address this matter.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding the
study of the environmental causes of birth defects in Rivine
and Volyn oblasts, and unexploded ordnance and excess weapons
stockpiles in Ukraine.
The conference agreement includes conditions on
assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation, with
exceptions for specified humanitarian and security programs,
with respect to its adherence in the Northern Caucasus to
certain conventional arms and human rights conventions and
agreements, as proposed by both the House and the Senate. The
managers reiterate language in the Statement of the Managers
from prior years with regard to other limitations on
assistance, ``that assistance to combat infectious diseases, .
. . support for regional and municipal governments, and
partnerships between United States hospitals, universities,
judicial training institutions and environmental organizations
and counterparts in Russia should not be affected by this
section.''
The conference agreement continues current restrictions
on United States assistance to the Government of the Russian
Federation, unless it provides full access to Chechnya for
humanitarian relief organizations. The managers deplore the
violations of human rights by both rebels and Russian security
forces in Chechnya, as well as the forced resettlement to
Chechnya of refugees who are living in appalling conditions.
The managers urge the Administration to be more vigorous in
pressing the Russian Government to seriously address these
concerns.
The conference agreement includes language providing
$17,500,000 for the Russian Far East, as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement again directs the Coordinator of
Assistance to the Independent States to obligate not less than
$1,500,000, primarily through locally-based and indigenous
private voluntary organizations, to reduce trafficking in women
and children.
The managers note that request levels for several
countries in the former Soviet Union are declining rapidly, and
request that the Coordinator consult with the Committees as he
works with USAID to develop new country strategies leading
toward eventual graduation of these countries from the United
States foreign assistance programs.
Independent Agencies
INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION
The conference agreement appropriates $16,200,000 instead
of $16,000,000 as proposed by the House and $16,385,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION
The conference agreement appropriates $18,689,000 instead
of $19,689,000 as proposed by the House and $17,689,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
pertaining to earned interest.
PEACE CORPS
The conference agreement provides $297,000,000 instead of
$317,000,000 as proposed by the House and $285,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The managers have included House language waiving the so-
called ``five-year rule'' of employment in the case of
employees whose appointment involves the safety of Peace Corps
volunteers, such as regional safety security officers and
employees within the Office of Inspector General.
Department of State
INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
The conference agreement appropriates $197,000,000 for
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement as proposed
by the House instead of $196,713,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement provides that $10,000,000 should
be made available for anti-trafficking in persons programs. The
Senate amendment provided $20,000,000 for this purpose, and the
House did not address this matter.
The conference agreement also provides that $10,000,000
should be made available for the demand reduction program, as
proposed by the House. The Senate did not address this matter.
Additionally, the conference agreement includes language
directing that from funds provided under this heading not less
than $5,000,000 shall be apportioned directly to the Department
of the Treasury, International Affairs Technical Assistance, to
be used for financial crimes and law enforcement technical
assistance programs. The apportionment of these funds will
allow the Department of Treasury to respond to host governments
in a more expeditious manner than presently is occurring.
The managers endorse Senate and House report language
regarding ILEA, and expect the administration to provide
sufficient funding to complete construction on the Roswell
Center.
The conference agreement makes available $24,180,000 for
administrative expenses instead of $24,062,000 as proposed by
the House and $24,300,000 as proposed by the Senate.
ANDEAN COUNTERDRUG INITIATIVE
The conference agreement appropriates $700,000,000 for
the Andean Counterdrug Initiative instead of $731,000,000 as
proposed by the House and $650,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
Additionally, the conference agreement allows for the
authority to provide up to $31,000,000 through a permissive
transfer from the International Narcotics Control and Law
Enforcement funds. Such a transfer is subject to the regular
notification procedures of the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations. The managers emphasize that there are other
funds for Andean nations in this Act that may be made available
for the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI).
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$250,000,000 shall be directly apportioned to U.S. Agency for
International Development, instead of $225,000,000 as provided
in the Senate amendment. This provision was not included in the
House bill.
The managers have extended the availability of funds
provided for assistance for Colombia to support a unified
campaign against narcotics trafficking, against activities by
organizations designated as terrorist organizations, and to
take actions to protect health and human welfare. This
provision is identical to that in the House bill and similar to
the provision included in the Senate amendment in section 563.
The managers are supportive of the Colombian Government in its
attempts to provide security for the Colombian people and have
provided the expansion of authorities in recognition that the
narcotics industry is linked to the terrorist groups, including
the paramilitary organizations, in Colombia. However, the
managers still conclude that coca provides the revenue and a
motive for the violence committed by both the guerrilla and
paramilitary groups. Therefore, the managers expect
counternarcotics, alternative development, and judicial reform
to remain the principal focus of United States policy in
Colombia. The expanded authority is not a signal from the
managers for the United States to become more deeply involved
in assisting the Colombian Armed Forces in fighting the
terrorist groups, especially not at the expense of the
counternarcotics programs, but to provide the means for more
effective intelligence gathering and fusion, and to provide the
flexibility to the Department of State when the distinction
between counternarcotics and counterterrorism is not clear cut.
The managers direct the Secretary of State to report to the
Committees on Appropriations not later than 90 days after
enactment of the changes in United States policy, including new
procedures and operations, as a result of implementing the
expanded authorities.
The conference agreement includes House language that
provides that the expanded authority shall cease to be
effective if the Secretary of State has credible evidence that
the Colombian Armed Forces are not conducting vigorous
operations to restore government authority and human rights in
areas under the effective control of paramilitary and guerrilla
organizations. This provision is not included in the Senate
amendment.
The managers note the requirement in the Act that the
Secretary of State, in consultation with the Administrator of
U.S. Agency for International Development, shall provide to the
Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after the
date of the enactment of this Act and prior to the initial
obligation of funds appropriated under this heading, a report
on the proposed uses of all funds under this heading on a
country-by-country basis for each proposed program, project, or
activity. This report is similar to the report required in the
fiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental appropriations act and
is required again in fiscal year 2003 given the managers'
disappointment in the level of pertinent information included
in the Department of State's Congressional Budget Justification
and congressional notifications.
Additionally, the conference agreement does not include
Senate language making all funds under this heading subject to
notification. The House bill did not include this language. The
managers note that in section 520, all funds provided for
Colombia are subject to notification.
The conference agreement continues current caps on the
number of United States military personnel and United States
civilian contractors in Colombia, as well as the current
prohibition on participation by such persons in combat
operations in connection with assistance made available by this
Act.
The conference agreement again includes conditions on the
aerial spraying of herbicide, similar to the Senate amendment,
to ensure that any use of such chemicals is consistent with the
Colombian Environmental Management Plan, with Environmental
Protection Agency regulations, and to ensure that chemicals
used in the aerial fumigation of coca do not pose unreasonable
health or safety risks to humans or the environment. The
managers intend and expect that every reasonable precaution
will be taken in the aerial fumigation program to ensure that
the exposure to humans and the environment in Colombia meets
Environmental Protection Agency standards for comparable use in
the United States.
Additionally, the managers direct the Secretary of State
to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, not
later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, describing (1)
the steps the Department of State is taking to enhance
environmental safeguards of the fumigation program, including
implementing the recommendations of the Environmental
Protection Agency in the fiscal year 2002 fumigation report;
(2) the Department's plan to conduct an independent, long-term
program to monitor the health and environmental effects of the
fumigation program, including conducting soil and water tests
in areas sprayed, toxicity tests on the spray formulation, and
ground verification missions to evaluate over-spray; and (3)
steps taken to implement environmental training programs for
fumigation pilots.
The conference agreement includes the House language
prohibiting funds for the resumption of flights in support of a
Peruvian air interdiction program until a system of enhanced
safeguards are in place. The Senate did not address this
matter.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$5,000,000 from funds under this heading or under the heading
``Foreign Military Financing'' should be made available to
support a Colombian Armed Forces unit dedicated to apprehending
the leaders of paramilitary organizations. The Senate amendment
included similar language but made the provision of funds
mandatory. The House did not address this matter. The managers
believe that the capture of these individuals, for which there
are numerous outstanding arrest warrants, could contribute
significantly to reducing atrocities against civilians by these
terrorist organizations as well as enhancing public confidence
in the Colombian Government's ability to protect public safety.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$1,500,000 should be made available for vehicles, equipment,
and other assistance for the human rights unit of the
Procurador General, instead of language proposed by the Senate
that provides that not less than $2,000,000 shall be made
available for such assistance. The House did not address this
matter.
Additionally, the conference agreement provides that not
less than $3,000,000 should be made available for software and
training for the Colombian National Police. The Senate
amendment included similar language but made the provision of
funds mandatory. The House did not address this matter.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$3,500,000 shall be made available for the Colombian National
Park Service. This language is identical to the provision in
the Senate amendment. The House did not address this matter.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding this
issue.
The managers endorse the language in the House report
directing that the Department of State immediately terminate
its inter-agency agreement with the Department of Justice and
transfer remaining funds to the U.S. Agency for International
Development for development, rule of law, and humanitarian
assistance programs.
The conference agreement makes available $15,680,000 for
administrative expenses of the Department of State as proposed
by the House instead of $14,800,000 as proposed by the Senate.
MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE
The conference agreement appropriates $787,000,000 for
Migration and Refugee Assistance as proposed by the Senate,
instead of $800,000,000 as proposed by the House. The
conference agreement makes available $16,565,000, for
administrative expenses as proposed by the Senate instead of
$16,000,000 as proposed in the House.
The conference agreement also includes language from the
Senate amendment that provides not less than $60,000,000 for
refugees from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and
other refugees resettling in Israel. The House addressed this
matter in the House report.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
providing that funds should be made available to international
organizations for assistance for refugees from North Korea.
However, the managers remain concerned with the plight of these
refugees and expect that funding will be provided to safeguard
the human rights and dignity of North Korean refugees and
asylum seekers. The managers also expect that funds will be
made available for assistance for those Burmese exiles who have
fled to Thailand. The managers strongly encourage the State
Department to consult on an ongoing basis with the appropriate
Thai authorities, including through the establishment of a
working group, to determine how best to assist these exiles.
UNITED STATES EMERGENCY MIGRATION AND REFUGEE ASSISTANCE FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $26,000,000 for the
U.S. Emergency Migration and Refugee Assistance Fund (ERMA),
instead of $20,000,000 as proposed by the House and $32,000,000
as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement does not include language
included in the Senate amendment that provides the funds
notwithstanding section 2(c)(2) of the Migration and Refugee
Assistance Act of 1962. Section 2(c)(2) would limit
appropriated funds to this Fund if, when added, would cause the
balance of the fund to exceed $100,000,000.
NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS
The conference agreement appropriates $306,400,000 as
proposed by the Senate instead of $347,400,000 as proposed by
the House.
The managers intend that funds in this account be
allocated as follows:
($ in thousands)
Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund...................     $15,000
Export control and border security assistance...........     36,000
Science Centers/BW redirection..........................     52,000
International Atomic Energy Agency......................     52,900
CTBT Monitoring System..................................     17,300
Korean Peninsula Economic Development:
Organization (KEDO) administrative expenses.........      5,000
Anti-terrorism assistance...............................     64,200
Terrorist Interdiction Program..........................      5,000
Demining................................................     46,000
International Trust Fund for Demining...................     10,000
Small arms destruction..................................      3,000
--------------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total...........................................     306,400
The conference agreement includes a reduction of $900,000
from the budget request for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission monitoring system based on
revised information from the Department of State. The managers
have been informed that the amount of $17,300,000 will fully
fund the United States contribution to the CTBT Preparatory
Commission for fiscal year 2003. The conference agreement does
not contain House language requiring a report to the Committees
on Appropriations 15 days prior to the obligation of funds
forthe Commission. Also, it does not contain Senate language mandating
a specified level of funding for the Commission.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
restricting the use of assistance for the Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization (KEDO). The President is
authorized to waive this restriction in section 562 to provide
up to $5,000,000 for assistance for administrative expenses
only. To the extent these funds are not programmed for KEDO,
they should be reprogrammed for support for the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
authorizing not to exceed $675,000 for administrative expenses
associated with the demining program. The House bill did not
address this matter. The conference agreement does not contain
Senate language stating that $57,000,000 should be used for
demining and related activities; however, the managers support
$56,000,000 for these purposes, as identified above.
The conference agreement contains language similar to
that of the Senate amendment that authorizes not to exceed
$250,000 for the support of public-private partnerships for
mine action by grant, cooperative agreement, or contract. The
managers direct that the State Department provide a financial
plan for the use of these funds to the Committees on
Appropriations prior to the use of this authority. The House
bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement does not contain Senate language
providing that $4,000,000 should be available to support the
Small Arms Destruction Initiative; however, the managers
support $3,000,000 for this purpose, as identified above.
Department of the Treasury
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The conference agreement provides $10,800,000 for the
International Affairs Technical Assistance program of the
Department of the Treasury, instead of $11,000,000 as proposed
by the House, and $10,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The managers support the efforts of the Department of the
Treasury, International Affairs Technical Assistance, to assist
nations in their efforts to reduce financial crimes and
corruption by strengthening those governmental systems. The
Department of the Treasury has been providing technical
assistance for over a decade to nations facing economic
disruption due to systemic weaknesses, post conflict crises,
terrorist influences, or criminal practices. The managers urge
the Department of the Treasury to continue its current
technical assistance program and to strengthen its law
enforcement program with additional resident and intermittent
advisors. The Committee further directs the Department of the
Treasury to manage its technical assistance program in
accordance with its own policies and to report to the
Committees on Appropriations in the House and Senate on the
status of its efforts.
The managers endorse the language of the House report
with respect to the International Affairs Technical Assistance
program.
TITLE III--MILITARY ASSISTANCE
Funds Appropriated to the President
INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The conference agreement does not include language
proposed by the Senate that would have prohibited funds for
travel or other purposes that do not directly expose the
individual participants to government officials or institutions
or to other individuals or organizations engaged in activities
involving public policy. The House bill did not address this
matter. The managers are aware that the Department of Defense
is in the process of issuing revised guidance on the
Information Program to address issues related to this
provision. The managers request that the Department maintain
its consultations with the Committees on this guidance.
The conference agreement provides that funding for
Guatemala, Algeria and Nigeria shall be subject to the regular
notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.
The managers expect that, consistent with the letter sent
to the Congress by the Assistant Secretary of State for
Legislative Affairs, the Committees on Appropriations will be
consulted prior to the obligation of funds for an Indonesian
IMET program.
The conference agreement does not include a Senate
provision directing the Department of Defense to maintain a
record of students that complete the IMET program for at least
six years after graduation. The House bill did not address this
matter. The managers note that the Office of Management and
Budget has identified shortcomings in procedures to evaluate
the performance of the IMET program. The managers have
addressed this matter by including a general provision (section
581) requiring the Secretary of State to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations which describes the progress being
made in improving performance evaluation procedures for the
IMET program and implementing section 548 of the Foreign
Assistance Act.
FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement appropriates $4,072,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate instead of $4,080,200,000 as proposed by
the House.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
providing for the early disbursement of funds for Israel (as
well as certain funds for Egypt) within 30 days of enactment.
The House bill included this language, along with language that
provided for disbursement of funds for both countries by
October 31, 2002, whichever was later.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
that would have provided not less than $198,000,000 for
assistance for Jordan. The House bill did not address this
matter. The managers note that these funds have already been
obligated for assistance for Jordan.
The conference agreement does not contain language from
the Senate amendment that would have mandated not less than
$3,000,000 for Armenia. The managers expect the full IMET and
FMF funding requests for Armenia will be provided in fiscal
year 2003, and that a portion of the FMF funds should be used
to enhance communications capabilities. The House bill did not
address this matter.
The conference agreement provides that up to $93,000,000
of the funds appropriated under this heading may be transferred
to ``Andean Counterdrug Initiative'' for helicopters, training
and other assistance for the Columbian Armed Forces, rather
than up to $88,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House
bill would have authorized the transfer of up to $98,000,000
for this purpose to ``International Narcotics Control and Law
Enforcement''.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding the
contents of the Foreign Military Training Report, including
information on training activities by civilian contractors.
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding
projects in the southern Philippines and increased Foreign
Military Financing assistance to the Philippines.
PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS
The conference agreement appropriates $115,000,000
instead of $120,250,000 as proposed by the Senate and
$125,000,000 as proposed by the House.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
providing that $7,000,000 should be made available for
Afghanistan. The House bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
providing that not less than $50,000,000 should be made
available for Africa Regional Peacekeeping Operations and the
Africa Crisis Response Initiative. The House bill did not
address this matter. However, the managers are concerned that
adequate funding be maintained for peacekeeping operations in
Africa, and endorse the House and Senate report language on
this issue. The managers recommend up to $45,000,000 for such
activities.
TITLE IV--MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
Funds Appropriated to the President
International Financial Institutions
GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF)
The conference agreement appropriates $147,812,533 for
the Global Environment Facility as proposed by the House
instead of $177,812,533 as proposed by the Senate. The managers
intend for $107,500,000 of this amount is for the scheduled
United States contribution to the third replenishment of the
GEF, and $40,312,533 for past payments due.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
The conference agreement appropriates $850,000,000 for
the International Development Association (IDA), the
concessional lending facility of the World Bank, instead of
$874,338,333 as proposed by the House and $837,338,333 as
proposed by the Senate. The managers intend that the
appropriation be made available to fully provide for the first
scheduled payment under the Untied States commitment to the
thirteenth replenishment of IDA.
The managers have not included Senate language requiring
the Secretary of the Treasury to accord a high priority in the
next replenishment of IDA to provide new grant assistance to
HIPC-eligible countries given that a grants agreement was
included in the IDA-13 replenishment.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY
The conference agreement appropriates $1,631,000 for
paid-in capital for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA), the amount provided in the Senate amendment,
instead of $1,630,696 as proposed by the House bill. The
managers intend for the appropriation to be provided for past
payments due by the United States to MIGA. Approval for a
subscription to the appropriate amount of callable capital is
also included in the conference agreement.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTER-AMERICAN INVESTMENT CORPORATION
The conference agreement appropriates $18,351,667 for a
United States contribution to the Inter-American Investment
Corporation as proposed by the Senate, instead of $30,351,667
as proposed by the House.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTERPRISE FOR THE AMERICAS MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT
FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $24,590,667 for
past due payments by the United States to the Multilateral
Investment Fund as proposed by the House, instead of
$29,590,667 as proposed by the Senate.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND
The conference agreement provides $97,886,133 for the
United States contribution to the Asian Development Fund as
proposed by the House, instead of $100,386,133 as proposed by
the Senate.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND
The conference agreement appropriates $108,073,333 for
the African Development Fund as proposed by the Senate, instead
of $113,073,333 as proposed by the House.
CONTRIBUTION TO THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
The managers endorse Senate report language regarding the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS
The conference agreement provides $195,150,000 for
voluntary contributions to International Organizations and
Programs instead of $190,400,000 as proposed by the House and
$215,000,000 as proposed by Senate.
The managers have provided $11,000,000 for the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), an increase of $250,000
over the fiscal year 2002 level. The managers recognize UNEP's
role in addressing global environmental problems, and believe
United States support for UNEP is necessary to achieve
important U.S. environmental objectives. However, the managers
are very concerned that UNEP's inefficient governing process
impedes its effectiveness and must be reformed, if UNEP is to
continue to receive significant U.S. support in meeting the
world's increasingly complex environmental challenges.
The conference agreement retains Senate language which
provides $500,000 for a contribution to the International
Coffee Organization (ICO) if the United States rejoins the ICO
by June 1, 2003. The House bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement also provides that these funds should
be made available for a contribution to the United Nations
Center for Human Settlements (UNHABITAT), if the United States
does not rejoin the ICO by this date. These funds are to be in
addition to other funds made available for UNHABITAT under this
heading. The Senate bill provided $1,000,000 for UNHABITAT. The
House did not address this matter.
The managers do not have a position on rejoining the ICO
but urge the administration to consult with the Committees on
Appropriations in the House and Senate concerning a decision on
ICO membership.
The managers support the efforts of UNHABITAT to improve
the lives of destitute slum dwellers in developing countries.
The managers note that UNHABITAT has recently been revitalized
through a successful restructuring that has met United States
Government criteria for reform.
The managers intend that funds in this account be
allocated as follows:
($ in thousands)
UN Fund for Tech. Cooperation in Human Rights...........      1,500
UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture................      5,250

TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS
(NOTE: If House and Senate language is identical except
for a different section number or minor technical differences,
the section is not discussed in the Statement of Managers.)
Sec. 503. Limitation on Residence Expenses
The conference agreement sets a limitation of $100,500
for USAID official residence expenses as proposed by the
Senate, instead of $126,500 as proposed by the House.
Sec. 505. Limitation on Representational Allowances
The conference agreement sets a limitation of $125,000 on
representation allowances from funds appropriated for USAID as
proposed by the Senate, instead of $95,000 as proposed by the
House.
Sec. 507. Prohibition Against Direct Funding for Certain Countries
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that included in the Senate amendment regarding assistance for
Iraq. The House bill did not include such a provision.
The conference agreement provides that assistance or
other financing under this Act or under prior foreign
operations, export financing, and related programs
appropriations Acts may be provided for humanitarian and relief
assistance for Iraq notwithstanding the provisions of this
section or any other provision of law, including comparable
provisions contained in prior foreign operations, export
financing, and related programs appropriations Acts, if the
President determines that the provision of assistance or other
financing for Iraq is important to the national security
interests of the United States. Such assistance or financing
would be subject to the regular notification procedures of the
Committees on Appropriations, except that notifications shall
be transmitted at least 5 days in advance of obligations of
funds. In addition, the conference report requires the
President to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the
status of the allocation, obligation and expenditure of funds
made available for Iraq not later than every 60 days during
fiscal year 2003, beginning on March 1, 2003. Each report shall
include information on programs, projects, and activities that
are being funded or will be funded with such assistance or
financing, and the departments and agencies responsible for
managing each such program, project, and activity. The
authority to provide assistance for Iraq will expire on the
date of enactment of the first subsequent supplemental
appropriations Act for fiscal year 2003 that contains
supplemental funding for appropriations accounts contained in
this Act.
It is the intention of the managers that this authority
not be used inside Iraq, except for assessments of humanitarian
and relief needs by private or nongovernmental organizations,
prior to any military action against Iraq or, in the absence of
such action, prior to a change of regime in Iraq. The
limitation of the waiver to humanitarian and relief assistance
is not intended to preclude assistance for the promotion of
democracy or governance if the goal of such assistance is the
maintenance of social services and public order. The managers
expect that funds drawn from accounts in this Act under this
waiver will be promptly reimbursed through supplemental
funding.
Sec. 509. Transfers Between Accounts
The conference report includes House language on this
matter. The new provisions of this section would prohibit
transfers to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the
United States unless specifically authorized in this Act,
except for certain transfers authorized by provisions of the
Foreign Assistance Act. The managers note that a limit on
transfers from the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund is
included under that heading. In addition, transfers under
section 632(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act shall expressly
provide that the Inspector General for the agency receiving the
transfer shall perform periodic program and financial audits,
and allows for the cost of such audits to be covered by the
transfer.
Sec. 512. Countries in Default
The conference agreement includes House language that
prohibits assistance to the government of any country in
default on U.S. bilateral loans. The Senate amendment included
less restrictive provisions. This matter is addressed in the
Statement of the Managers under the heading ``Export-Import
Bank''.
Sec. 515. Notification Requirements
The conference agreement reflects a technical change
proposed by the House to include ``Capital Investment Fund'' in
the list of accounts that are subject to notification pursuant
to this section. The Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 520. Special Notification Requirements
The conference agreement adds ``Serbia'' as proposed in
the Senate amendment to the list of countries subject to the
special notification procedures of this section, but does not
include ``Haiti'' and ``Nigeria'' as recommended by the Senate.
The managers note that IMET assistance for Nigeria is subject
to notification under a provision in title III of this Act.
Sec. 521. Definition of Program, Project and Activity
The conference agreement restates current law regarding
the definition of program, project and activity, instead of
Senate language limiting the definition.
Sec. 522. Child Survival and Health Activities
The conference agreement authorizes USAID to use up to
$13,500,000 from the ``Child Survival and Health Programs
Fund'' and up to $3,500,000 from ``Development Assistance'' for
technical experts from other government agencies, universities,
and other institutions. The managers have decreased this
authority in order to accelerate the shift to USAID direct hire
personnel of responsibility for implementation and oversight of
USAID's expanded infectious disease and basic education
activities.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$446,500,000, as in current law, shall be made available for
reproductive health/family planning activities from funds
appropriated by this Act, including $368,500,000 from the Child
Survival and Health Programs Fund, $15,000,000 from Assistance
to the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union, and
$63,000,000 from other accounts such as the Economic Support
Fund, International Disaster Assistance, Assistance to Eastern
Europe and the Baltic States, and Migration and Refugee
Assistance.
Sec. 523. Afghanistan
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$295,500,000 of the funds appropriated by title II shall be
made available for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance
for Afghanistan, as proposed by the House. The Senate amendment
proposed not less than $213,000,000 for Afghanistan from titles
II and III. Of this amount, not less than $5,000,000 is for
activities supported by the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs
including multi-service women's resource centers in
Afghanistan.
The managers intend that funds provided under this
section be allocated as follows:
($ in thousands)
Child Survival and Health Programs Fund.................     50,000
Development Assistance..................................     40,500
International Disaster Assistance.......................     85,000
Transition Initiatives..................................     10,000
Economic Support Fund...................................     50,000
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, etc (NADR)............      5,000
USAID Operating Expenses................................     [9,350]
USAID IG Operating Expenses.............................      [500]
Migration and Refugee Assistance........................     55,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total...........................................     295,500
The conference agreement does not include a Senate
provision that not less than $1,500,000 should be made
available for the National Human Rights Commission of
Afghanistan. However, the managers recognize the critical need
for timely and credible investigations of the full range of
human rights violations in Afghanistan and expect USAID to
continue to support the Commission.
The conference agreement does not include Senate language
requiring a report by the Secretary of State that details
women's development programs in Afghanistan supported by the
United States Government, and barriers that impede women's
development in Afghanistan. However, the managers request the
Secretary to submit such a report, not later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act, including proposed United States
assistance programs and activities to overcome such barriers.
Sec. 525. Authorization Requirement
The conference agreement includes language that provides
that funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated and
expended notwithstanding section 10 of Public Law 91-672 and
section 15 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of
1956, as provided in the House bill and the Senate amendment.
It includes House language exempting the account ``Peace
Corps'' and Senate language exempting the accounts ``Trade and
Development Agency,'' ``Migration and Refugee Assistance'',
``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related
Programs'', ``International Military Education and Training''
and ``Foreign Military Financing Program'' from these waivers.
Sec. 526. Democracy Programs
The conference agreement contains language in subsection
(a) that provides not less than $15,000,000 shall be made
available for activities to support democracy, human rights,
and the rule of law in the People's Republic of China, Hong
Kong, and Tibet. Of these funds, not less than $9,000,000 shall
be provided through the Human Rights and Democracy Fund of the
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Department of
State and not less than $3,000,000 shall be provided through
the National Endowment for Democracy. In addition, subsection
(a) authorizes funding of not to exceed $3,000,000 for
nongovernmental organizations to support activities that
preserve cultural traditions and promote sustainable
development and environmental conservation in Tibetan
communities in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and in Tibetan
communities in China. In addition, funds should be made
available for Taiwan for the purposes of furthering political
and legal reforms to the extent that they are matched from
sources other than the United States Government. In addition,
the conference report provides not less than $15,000,000 for
programs and activities to foster democracy, human rights,
civic education, women's development, press freedoms, and the
rule of law in countries with a significant Muslim population,
and where such programs and activities would be important to
United States efforts to respond to, deter, or prevent acts of
international terrorism. Not less than $3,000,000 of these
funds should be made available for programs and activities that
provide professional training for journalists. Of the funds for
Muslim countries, not less than $7,000,000 shall be provided
through the Human Rights and Democracy Fund of the Bureau of
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Department of State and not
less than $5,000,000 shall be provided through the National
Endowment for Democracy. In addition, funds are authorized for
the advancement of democracy and human rights in Iran.
Funds provided in this section for the Human Rights and
Democracy Fund are in addition to the $12,000,000 budget
request for said Fund in fiscal year 2003. In addition, the
conference agreement includes language requiring a report from
the Secretary of State with 120 days of enactment on the
allocation, obligation, and expenditure of funds made available
for the National Endowment for Democracy. The Senate amendment
would have required the obligation and disbursement of such
funds within 90 days of enactment of this Act.
Of the $12,000,000 in base funds for the Human Rights and
Democracy Fund, the managers direct that $1,000,000 be provided
(within 120 days of enactment) for the Reagan/Fascell Program,
and $250,000 be provided for the North Korean human rights and
democracy program as identified in the Senate amendment under
``Economic Support Fund''.
All funds provided under this section are subject to the
regular notification procedures of the Committees on
Appropriations.
Sec. 527. Prohibition on Bilateral Assistance to Terrorist Countries
The conference agreement includes House language on this
matter, which prohibits funds to any country that the President
determines is supporting terrorism. The Senate amendment would
have prohibited funds to the government of any such country.
Sec. 528. Debt for Development
The conference agreement includes House language on this
matter. The Senate amendment would have authorized the use of
appropriated funds for endowments.
Sec. 533. Impact on Jobs in the United States
The conference agreement modifies the scope of this
section with respect to internationally recognized worker
rights as described in section 507 of the Trade Act of 1974, as
contained in the Senate amendment. The House bill did not
address this matter.
Sec. 534. Special Authorities
The conference agreement includes House language
providing certain authority for assistance for Lebanon and
Montenegro, and Senate language on authority for assistance for
Afghanistan, assistance to victims of trafficking, and
assistance to combat trafficking. The conference agreement does
not include House language, not in the Senate amendment, that
would have authorized assistance for Cambodia under section 541
of the Foreign Assistance Act notwithstanding certain other
restrictions contained in this Act. In addition, it does not
contain language from the Senate amendment, not in the House
bill, that would subject assistance for Cambodia to the
provisions of section 531(e) of the FAA and section 906 of the
International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985.
Those provisions have the effect of permanent law, and the
Senate language is therefore unnecessary.
The managers have reduced current authority for certain
bureaus and offices in USAID to hire personal service
contractors, continued existing authority for USAID to provide
support for administrative costs of a program to provide
information regarding available donated space on commercial
ships to organizations shipping humanitarian assistance, and
provides for expanded authorities under section 660(b)(6) of
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
The conference agreement includes Senate language
deleting a requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury
provide certain annual reports. The House did not address this
matter.
Sec. 535. Arab League Boycott of Israel
The conference report includes Senate language on this
matter, except that the ``Sense of the Congress'' rather than
the ``Sense of the Senate'' is invoked. Among other things, the
language calls upon the Arab League states to normalize
relations (including the reinstatement of ambassadors by the
three Arab League nations with relations with Israel) with
Israel. The House bill contained current law on this matter.
Sec. 537. Eligibility for Assistance
The conference agreement consolidates current language
regarding assistance to non-governmental organizations in
certain countries as proposed by the Senate. The House bill did
not change current law.
Sec. 543. Prohibition on Assistance to Foreign Governments that Export
Lethal Military Equipment to Countries Supporting International
Terrorism
The conference agreement reflects the House language that
includes a technical correction not included in the Senate
amendment.
Sec. 544. Withholding of Assistance for Parking Fines Owed by Foreign
Countries
The conference agreement allows 110 percent of the total
amount of unpaid parking fines determined to be owed by foreign
countries to the District of Columbia and New York City, New
York, to be withheld from obligation for assistance to such
country, as proposed by the Senate. The language is similar to
that proposed by the House.
Sec. 546. War Crimes Tribunals Drawdown
The conference agreement includes House and Senate
language authorizing up to $30,000,000 in drawdowns of
commodities or services for war crimes tribunals. The
conference agreement includes House language that specifies
that any drawdown made under this section shall not be
construed as an endorsement or precedent for the establishment
of any standing or permanent international criminal tribunal or
court. The Senate amendment did not address this matter.
Sec. 549. Prohibition of Payment of Certain Expenses
The conference agreement includes Senate language, not in
the House bill, that adds theatrical and musical productions to
the list of activities prohibited under this section.
Sec. 550. Restrictions on Voluntary Contributions to United Nations
Agencies
The conference agreement is similar to the House bill but
deletes the certification requirement. The Senate did not
address this matter.
Sec. 551. Caribbean Basin
The conference agreement makes certain purchases of
defense articles and services available to the Haitian Coast
Guard but does not include House language, not in the Senate
amendment, requiring that such transfers be subject to
notification.
The conference agreement provides that not less than
$52,500,000 should be allocated for assistance to Haiti from
funds in title II of this Act and food assistance fund managed
by USAID. This provision is identical to language in the House
bill and was not included in the Senate amendment.
Additionally, the conference agreement includes identical
language as included in the House bill that provides that out
of funds in title II of this Act, $37,680,000 should be
allocated for Nicaragua and $40,130,000 should be allocated for
Honduras. The Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 554. Protection of Biodiversity and Tropical Forests
The conference agreement includes language directing that
USAID should make available $145,000,000 for programs and
activities that directly protect biodiversity. The managers
strongly support these efforts and expect these funds to be
used to protect tropical forests, including support of projects
to deter illegal logging in Indonesia, Central Africa and
elsewhere, and other threatened biologically diverse areas,
both terrestrial and marine. Of this amount, up to $40,000,000
may be available for the subsidy cost of modifying loans and
loan guarantees, pursuant to the provisions of the Tropical
Forest Conservation Act of 1998. The managers commend the
Administration for its Congo Basin Forest Initiative and expect
full funding to be made available for the Central African
Regional Program for the Environment.
Sec. 555. Energy Conservation, Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy
Programs
The managers support programs that conserve energy and
promote clean and efficient energy production and distribution
in developing countries. The conference agreement provides that
$175,000,000 should be made available for these programs.
This section also requires the Executive Office of the
President to submit an updated and revised annual government-
wide report on federal activities and costs relating to climate
change and greenhouse gas emissions. The House bill did not
address this matter.
Sec. 556. Zimbabwe
The conference agreement is the same as current law and
is identical to the Senate amendment. The House did not address
this matter.
Sec. 557. Nigeria
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that of the Senate amendment that restricts the use of IMET and
FMF for Nigeria until the President certifies to the Committee
on Appropriations that certain specified Nigerian officials are
suspending from the Armed Forces those members, of whatever
rank, against whom there is credible evidence of gross
violations of human rights in Benue State in October 2001, and
the Government of Nigeria and the Nigerian Armed Forces are
taking effective measures to bring such individuals to justice.
The President may waive such prohibition if he determines that
doing so is in the national security interest of the United
States. Prior to exercising such waiver authority, the
President is required to submit a report to the Committees on
Appropriations describing the involvement of the Nigerian Armed
Forces in the incident in Benue State, the measures that are
being taken to bring such individuals to justice, and whether
any Nigerian Armed Forces units involved with the incident in
Benue State are receiving United States assistance. The
managers expect the Department of State will consult with the
Committees on Appropriations on the form the report will take.
Sec. 558. Burma
The conference agreement includes a modified version of
the Senate's provision on the use of the Economic Support Fund
in Burma and along the Burma-Thailand border, and, in addition,
a House provision, similar to language in prior year Acts,
regarding independent media activities promoting democracy
inside Burma.
The managers deplore the failure of Burma's State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC) to resume dialogue with Daw Aung
San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and urge the
immediate release of all prisoners of conscience in Burma. The
managers continue to expect that United States Government
programs and activities conducted inside Burma, including HIV/
AIDS programs, will be carried out in consultation with the
leadership of the National League for Democracy.
The managers note the systematic abuse of human rights by
the SPDC, especially in campaigns of violence against Burmese
minorities, including rape of girls and women and forced
evacuations of villages. These campaigns have displaced an
estimated one million persons inside of Burma and an equal
number in neighboring countries.
In order to expand the provision of health services to
displaced Burmese, including those who live in appalling
conditions outside of refugee camps in Thailand, the managers
expect that $1,000,000 will be provided to continue to support
efforts to combat HIV/AIDS inside of Burma, and that not less
than $1,000,000 will be provided to support efforts to limit
malaria and infectious diseases among Burmese along the Burma-
Thailand border. These funds are to be made available under the
heading ``Child Survival and Health Programs Fund'' in this
Act, and are in addition to the amounts provided under this
section.
The managers request that within 120 days of enactment of
the Act, the Administrator of USAID, in consultation with the
Department of State, provide a report to the Committees on
Appropriations that describes the estimated number and
condition of displaced persons inside Burma and Burmese
refugees, exiles, or migrant workers in Thailand and proposes
steps that the United States Government could take, working
with other donors and not providing direct support to the SPDC,
to address the root causes of this crisis and to better provide
for the humanitarian needs of displaced Burmese.
The managers recommend that up to $500,000 be made
available to support a new initiative inside Burma that
utilizes the expertise of the leadership of the National League
for Democracy (NLD) in determining and addressing the urgent
needs of the people of Burma. The managers recommend that the
State Department consult with the NLD on the development of
this initiative, and request to be regularly updated on its
progress.
Sec. 560. Cambodia
The conference agreement includes House language
providing that the Secretary of the Treasury should instruct
U.S. executive directors of international financial
institutions to oppose loans to the Central Government of
Cambodia, except loans to support basic human needs. The Senate
amendment would have mandated such instructions. In subsection
(b), the conference agreement contains language similar to that
of the Senate amendment that prohibits assistance for the
Central Government of Cambodia, except that this provision does
not apply to assistance for basic education, reproductive and
maternal and child health, cultural and historic preservation,
and for the Ministry of Women and Veterans Affairs to combat
human trafficking, and for certain assistance provided through
nongovernmental organizations. The House bill restricted
assistance except for basic education and assistance provided
under ``Child Survival and Health Programs Fund''.
In subsection (c), the conference agreement provides that
up to $5,000,000 may be made available, notwithstanding the
above restriction, for activities to support democracy,
including democratic political parties in Cambodia. In
subsection (d), the conference agreement provides that
$3,750,000 of the funds made available in this Act shall be
made available, notwithstanding the above restriction, as a
contribution for an endowment to sustain rehabilitation
programs for Cambodians suffering from physical disabilities
that are administered by an American nongovernmental
organization that is directly supported by USAID. Such funds
may be made available only if an amount at least equal to one-
half the United States contribution is provided for the
endowment from sources other than the United States Government.
The managers endorse the Senate report language regarding this
issue. The House bill did not address these matters.
The managers condemn the recent riots in Cambodia, and
are concerned with the Cambodian Government's failure to
protect foreign embassies and foreign-owned businesses in Phnom
Penh. The managers note that in a statement issued on February
6, 2003, the State Departmentstated that the United States was
``particularly concerned by indications that the government is using
the situation to target the political opposition and independent
media''. The managers request that within 60 days of enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of State report to the Committees on Appropriations
on the complicity of the Cambodian Government in the riots (including
an explanation of the failure of Cambodian authorities to respond to
the riots in a timely and effective manner), and steps taken by the
governments of Thailand and Cambodia to credibly investigate the riots.
The managers encourage the administration to continue to forcefully and
publicly condemn election-related violence and intimidation in the run
up to the July parliamentary elections.
Sec. 562. Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that of the Senate amendment that prohibits funding for the
Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), except
for up to $5,000,000 for administrative expenses if the
President determines that it is vital to the national security
interests of the United States. Such funding is subject to
notification. The House bill would have limited funding for
KEDO to $50,000,000 only for administrative expenses and heavy
fuel oil costs associated with the Agreed Framework. In
addition, the House bill required several certifications by the
President prior to the obligation of funding for KEDO.
Section 563. Palestinian Statehood
The conference agreement includes House language that
prohibits funding to support a Palestinian state unless the
Secretary of State makes certain determinations, including: a
new leadership of a Palestinian governing entity has been
democratically elected through credible and competitive
elections; the elected governing entity has demonstrated a firm
commitment to peaceful co-existence with Israel; is taking
appropriate measures to counter terrorism; and is establishing
a new Palestinian security entity that is fully cooperative
with appropriate Israeli and other appropriate security
organizations; and the Palestinian Authority or its successor
is working with other countries in the region to vigorously
pursue efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East, including normal relations between
Israel and an independent Palestinian state in a number of
areas. It also expresses the sense of the Congress that the
newly elected governing entity should enact a constitution
assuring the rule of law, an independent judiciary, respect for
human rights, and other laws and regulations assuring
transparent and accountable governance. This section also
includes a waiver of the restrictions herein based on national
security interests of the United States, and exempts assistance
to the Palestinian Authority and affiliated institutions, or a
newly elected governing entity, in order to help meet the
requirements of this section, consistent with the provisions of
section 552 of this Act. The Senate amendment contained
language similar to the House bill on this matter.
Section 564. Colombia
The conference agreement includes a modified version of
the House and Senate provisions on conditioning funds for
Colombian Armed Forces.
Sec. 567. Iraq
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that in the House bill, which provides that funds from the
Economic Support Fund may be made available for programs
benefiting the Iraqi people and to support efforts to bring
about political transition in Iraq. The conference agreement
also includes language that provides that none of the funds
made available pursuant to the authorities provided in this
section may be made available to any organization to reimburse
or pay for costs incurred by such organization in prior fiscal
years. Funds would be subject to the regular notification
procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.
Sec. 568. West Bank and Gaza Program
The conference report includes House language on this
matter. It contains prior year language (also in the Senate
amendment) requiring the Comptroller General of the United
States to certify that procedures have been established to
assure access to appropriate financial information in order to
review the uses of funds provided for the West Bank and Gaza
Program of the Economic Support Fund. In addition, the language
requires the Secretary of State to take all appropriate steps
to ensure that assistance is not provided to entities or
individuals that advocate, plan, sponsor, engage in, or have
engaged in, terrorist activity. Finally, the language requires
annual audits of all contractors and grantees, and significant
subcontractors and subgrantees. Up to $1,000,000 is authorized
to be made available to the Inspector General of the United
States Agency for International Development for audits,
inspections, and other activities in furtherance of this
provision.
Sec. 569. Indonesia
The conference agreement includes language similar to
that of the Senate amendment on this matter. It would allow
assistance for Indonesia appropriated under ``Foreign Military
Financing Program'' and licenses for export of lethal defense
articles for the Indonesian military only if the President
certifies that the Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian
Armed Forces are taking certain measures, including suspending
from the Armed Forces those members, of whatever rank, who have
been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of
human rights, or aided or abetted militia groups, as well as
prosecuting those members and punishing them, if they have been
found to have committed such acts. In addition, the language
requires the President to certify that the Indonesian Armed
Forces are cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial
authorities in such cases, including providing access to
witnesses, relevant military documents, and other requested
information. Finally, the language requires the President to
certify that the Minister of Defense is making publicly
available audits of receipts and expenditures of the Indonesian
Armed Forces. The House bill included similar language, but did
not address the issue of export licenses for lethal defense
articles.
Sec. 570. Restrictions on Assistance to Governments Destabilizing
Sierra Leone
The conference agreement includes a provision identical
to the House bill that prohibits assistance to any government
for which the Secretary of State has credible evidence that
such government has aided or abetted, within the previous six
months, in the illicit distribution, transportation, or sale of
diamonds mined in Sierra Leone. The language is similar to the
Senate amendment.
Sec. 572. Contributions to the United Nations Population Fund
The managers note that $34,000,000 appropriated for the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in P.L. 107-115 has not
been obligated due to a determination by the Secretary of State
in July 2002 that UNFPA's program in the People's Republic of
China was in violation of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The
conference agreement provides that these prior year funds, and
an equivalent amount from this Act, shall be made available to
UNFPA if the President determines that UNFPA is no longer in
violation of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The conference
agreement also contains a prohibition on the use of United
States funds in China as well as all other restrictions in
current law.
Sec. 573. Procurement and Financial Management Reform
The conference agreement includes House language
withholding 10 percent of the funds made available for
international financial institutions until the Secretary of the
Treasury certifies that a number of procurement and financial
management reforms are being implemented. The Senate did not
address this matter.
Sec. 574. Central Asia
The conference agreement includes the identical provision
included in the Senate amendment that conditions the assistance
to the Government of Uzbekistan unless the Secretary of State
determines and reports that the Government of Uzbekistan is
making progress and meeting commitments of the Declaration of
Strategic Partnership. The House addressed this matter in title
II.
The conference agreement includes a provision similar to
the Senate provision related to human rights and democracy in
Central Asia, but adds a national security interest waiver for
the Secretary of State with regard to assistance for
Kazakhstan. The managers urge the Secretary to pursue an
agreement with the Government of Kazakhstan similar to the
Declaration on the Strategic Partnership and Cooperation
Framework signed by the United States and the Government of
Uzbekistan addressing democracy, human rights and other matters
of mutual interest.
The conference agreement contains a provision similar to
the Senate amendment requiring the Secretary of State to submit
periodic reports on the provision of defense articles and
financial assistance to the countries of Central Asia. The
House did not address this matter.
Sec. 576. War Criminals
The conference agreement contains language similar to
that in both the House bill and Senate amendment regarding war
criminals in the Balkans.
Sec. 577. User Fees
The conference agreement includes the Senate language
that expands the current law restriction requiring the
Secretary of Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors
to oppose any loan, grant strategy or policy that would require
user fees on poor people for primary education or healthcare in
connection with the institutions' financing programs. The House
provision reflected current law.
Sec. 578. Funding for Serbia
The conference agreement contains current law on this
matter, except that the provisions of this section affect
assistance for Serbia after June 15 of this year, rather than
after March 30 as in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations Act.
In addition, technical modifications have been inserted to
refer to a successor state to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY).
The House bill would have applied the provisions of this
section to assistance for the governments of Serbia and the
FRY. The Senate bill would have imposed certain additional
requirements on the FRY beyond those in current law.
Sec. 579. Prohibition on Taxation of United States Assistance
The conference agreement contains language similar to
that of the House bill that provides that none of the funds
appropriated in this Act may be made available to provide
assistance for a foreign country under a new bilateral
agreement governing the terms and conditions under which such
assistance is to be provided unless such agreement includes a
provision stating that commodities purchased with assistance
provided by the United States shall be exempt from taxation, or
reimbursed, by the foreign government, and the Secretary of
State shall expeditiously seek to negotiate amendments to
existing bilateral agreements, as necessary, to conform with
this requirement. The language also requires that, of the funds
appropriated by this Act that are allocated for assistance for
a foreign country and for the West Bank and Gaza Program, an
amount equivalent to 200 percent of the total taxes assessed
during fiscal year 2003 against United States assistance
programs by a foreign government or entity, either directly or
through grantees, contractors and subcontractors, shall be
withheld from assistance for such country or entity in fiscal
year 2004 to the extent that the Secretary of State certifies
and reports in writing to the Committees on Appropriations that
such taxes have not been reimbursed to the Government of the
United States. Foreign taxes of a de minimis nature are not
subject to these reimbursement provisions. Of the funds
withheld from obligation for each country or entity pursuant to
this section, one-half may become available for reprogramming
for other purposes (pursuant to section 515 of this Act and
consistent with the purposes for which such funds were
originally appropriated) and one-half shall be deposited in the
General Fund of the Treasury on, or within 5 days after,
September 1, 2004. The language also requires the Secretary of
State to issue rules, regulations, or policy guidance, as
appropriate, to implement the prohibition against the taxation
of assistance contained in this section. The Senate amendment
did not address this matter.
Sec. 580. GAO Report
The conference report contains language similar to that
of the House bill that requires a report from the Comptroller
General to the Committees on Appropriations no later than
November 1, 2003, on the extent to which the Department of
State is complying with section 301(c) of the Foreign
Assistance Act and on the implementation of procedures that
have been established to meet the standards of the Department
of State regarding compliance with the requirements of said
section. This audit shall review the implementation of
procedures by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) regarding this
provision of law. The conference agreement does not include
language from the House requiring a report from the Secretary
of State on this matter, but the managers are agreed that the
Secretary shall comply with the requirements of the House bill
in this regard.
Sec. 582. Community-Based Police Assistance
The conference agreement includes language similar to the
Senate language authorizing use of certain USAID-administered
funds in title II of this Act for support for civilian police
in Jamaica and El Salvador, but not Indonesia as included in
the Senate amendment, notwithstanding section 660 of the
Foreign Assistance Act. The House did not address this matter.
Sec. 583. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import
Bank Restrictions
The conference agreement includes a provision identical
to the Senate amendment and current law and prohibits the use
of funds by OPIC and Export-Import Bank from financing
investments in connection with a project involving the mining,
polishing or other processing, or sale of diamonds in a country
that fails to implement the recommendations, obligations and
requirements developed by the Kimberley Process or taking
measures that the Secretary of State determines to contribute
effectively to preventing and eliminating the trade in conflict
diamonds.
Sec. 584. Trade Capacity Building
The conference agreement includes a provision identical
to the House bill that provides that not less than $452,000,000
should be made available for trade capacity building assistance
from the Trade and Development Agency, Development Assistance,
Transition Initiatives, ESF, International Affairs Technical
Assistance, and International Organizations and Programs
accounts. The Senate did not address this matter.
Sec. 585. Transparency and Accountability
The conference agreement includes Senate language
requiring the Secretary of State to submit a report concerning
the public disclosure of revenues from extractive industries
and other sources by governments of countries that receive
United States assistance. The House did not address this
matter. The managers endorse the Senate report language
regarding this issue.
Sec. 586. American Churchwomen and Other Citizens in El Salvador and
Guatemala
The conference agreement contains Senate language on this
matter. The House bill contained similar language.
PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED BY THE CONFEREES:
The conference agreement does not include section 549 of
the Senate amendment regarding ``Tibet'' urging U.S. Executive
Directors to International Financial Institutions to support
certain types of projects in Tibet. The House bill did not
address a similar provision. The managers are aware of concerns
raised by the Department of the Treasury about this provision,
however, the managers strongly support the intent of this
provision and expect to be consulted prior to votes in the
International Financial Institutions on projects in Tibet.
The conference report does not include section 554 of the
House bill regarding ``Discrimination Against Minority
Religious Faiths in the Russian Federation.'' The Senate did
not include this provision.
The conference report does not include section 555 of the
House bill regarding ``Assistance for the Middle East.'' The
Senate amendment did not address this matter.
The conference report does not include section 565 of the
House bill regarding ``Briefings on Potential Purchases of
Defense Articles or Defense Services by Taiwan.'' The Senate
did not address this matter. This matter is addressed in
permanent law.
The conference report does not include section 578 of the
Senate bill regarding ``Excess Defense Articles for Central and
Southern European Countries and Certain Other Countries.'' The
House did not address this matter. These authorities already
exist for fiscal year 2003.
The conference report does not include section 579 of the
House bill ``Tropical Forest Conservation.'' The text of this
provision is included in section 554 ``Protection of
Biodiversity and Tropical Forests.''
The conference report does not include section 580 of the
House bill regarding ``Authorizations''. The Senate amendment
did not address this matter.
The conference report does not include section 581 of the
House bill and section 580 of the Senate amendment regarding
Cuba.
The conference agreement does not include section 583 of
the Senate amendment regarding ``Regional Democracy Programs
for East Asia and the Pacific.'' The House did not address this
matter.
The conference agreement does not include section 585 of
the Senate amendment extending the prohibition of oil and gas
drilling in the Great Lakes of the United States. The House
bill did not address this matter.
The conference agreement does not include section 586 of
the Senate amendment regarding the ``Sense of the Senate with
Respect to North Korea''. The House did not address this
matter.

DIVISION F
Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations
The conference agreement on the Interior and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003, incorporates some of the
provisions of H.R. 5093 as passed by the House of
Representatives on July 18, 2002, and the Senate version of
H.J. Res. 2 (Division F and Division N) as passed by the Senate
on January 23, 2003. Report language and allocations set forth
in either House Report 107-564 or the Senate report language
published in the Congressional Record of January 15, 2003, that
are not changed by the conference are approved by the committee
of conference. The statement of the managers, while repeating
some report language for emphasis, does not negate the language
referenced above unless expressly provided herein.
No funds in this Act are derived from the Conservation
Spending Category established in the Department of the Interior
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001. However, the
programs previously funded under this category are, for the
most part, continued in fiscal year 2003.
TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
Bureau of Land Management
MANAGEMENT OF LANDS AND RESOURCES
The conference agreement provides $825,712,000 for
management of lands and resources instead of $826,932,000 as
proposed by the House and $816,062,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
Increases above the House for land resources include
$1,000,000 for noxious weeds for the Montana State University
weed program, $500,000 for Idaho weed control, and a decrease
of $500,000 for range monitoring.
There is a decrease below the House for wildlife and
fisheries of $500,000 for fisheries management.
There is a decrease below the House for threatened and
endangered species of $87,000 for travel.
Increases above the House for recreation management
include $1,000,000 for Missouri River undaunted stewardship,
$400,000 for Colorado Canyons, and decreases of $250,000 for
recreation access, and $302,000 for conversion of certain lands
to fee sites.
The managers do not concur with the House proposal
concerning funding for the energy and minerals program. Funding
for this program shall be at the level proposed for activities
in the request but with the following modifications. An
increase of $750,000 for permitting of geothermal energy
applications and wind energy rights-of-way in Nevada,
$1,000,000 for applications for permits to drill, principally
in the Powder River Basin, and $272,000 for the Alaska minerals
program.
Increases above the House for realty and ownership
management include $2,000,000 for Alaska conveyance, $1,100,000
for the cadastral survey program, of which $750,000 is for
continuation of the public lands database in AK, $350,000 is
for the State of Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center,
and $750,000 is for additional Nevada personnel.
The managers have modified the Senate language concerning
the Alaska conveyance program. The managers expect the Bureau
to develop a plan to complete work on all allotment
applications and all land selections under the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act of 1971 and the Alaska Statehood Act of
1959 by 2009, 50 years after its enactment and nearly 40 years
after the deadline for applying for Native allotments.
Increases above the House for resources protection and
maintenance include $500,000 for the Alaska resources library
and decreases of $200,000 for desert rangers, and $300,000 for
the restoration of lands in Arizona.
Increases above the House for transportation and
facilities maintenance include $250,000 for the Iditarod
National Historic Trail, $1,000,000 for capping oil wells in
National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and decreases of $200,000 for
California Desert communications, and $2,000,000 for fish
passage improvements.
There is a decrease below the House for land and
resources information of $403,000.
There is a decrease below the House for challenge cost
share of $5,000,000. The conference agreement includes an
increase of $5,000,000 in the challenge cost share program for
the Cooperative Conservation Initiative.
WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT
The conference agreement provides $654,406,000 for
wildland fire management instead of $855,332,000 as proposed by
the House and $654,254,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Decreases below the House for preparedness include
$826,000 for travel and $600,000 for fire employment duration.
There is an increase above the House for other operations
of $500,000 for the University of Montana fire program.
There is a decrease below the House of $200,000,000,
which had been proposed as a fiscal year 2002 emergency
supplemental appropriation. The managers note that in lieu of
these funds the Department has been provided $189,000,000 for
fire reimbursement elsewhere in the bill.
The managers note that the Department of the Interior and
the Department of Agriculture have begun full implementation of
the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy to reduce wildland fire
risks. This strategy involves extensive collaboration with
communities in the selection of hazardous fuels projects. In
support of the strategy, the Departments have developed
detailed criteria for the execution of such hazardous fuels
reduction efforts. The managers feel that collaboration with
communities and the use of criteria for project selection
provide a suitable basis for planning the expenditure of funds,
and accordingly do not concur with Senate report language
requiring that seventy percent of hazardous fuels funds be used
in the wildland urban interface.
Because of the managers continuing concern about fire
suppression costs during major incidents, the Forest Service
and the Department of the Interior are directed to contract
with the National Academy of Public Administration for
appropriate follow-up work to their study of 2002. The
Departments should equally share the cost of the review and the
review should be conducted forthwith.

The Committee has consistently supported the West Eugene
Wetlands acquisition program over the years, and is aware that
the Federal portion of the acquisition program is nearing
completion. In order to conclude the project properly, certain
issues regarding the status of lands in the project area must
be resolved. Should these issues be resolved in a manner that
warrants additional Federal acquisition support, the managers
will consider providing funding to complete the project in
future budgets.
Funds for the Golden Bair Ranch are conditioned on BLM
providing public access to this property. The money for
Cosumnes River Watershed is restricted to conservation
easements only. The managers have reprogrammed Spring Gulch
funds to the Continental Divide NST and Devils Canyon Ranch as
proposed by the Senate.

appropriation for range improvements of not less than
$10,000,000 as proposed by the House and Senate.
SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES
The conference agreement provides an indefinite
appropriation for service charges, deposits, and forfeitures,
which is estimated to be $7,900,000 as proposed by the House
and Senate.
MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS
The conference agreement provides an indefinite
appropriation of $12,405,000 for miscellaneous trust funds as
proposed by the House and Senate.
UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
Resource Management
The conference agreement provides $917,429,000 for
resource management instead of $918,359,000 as proposed by the
House and $902,697,000 as proposed by the Senate. The numerical
changes described below are to the House recommended level.
In endangered species programs, there are increases in
candidate conservation of $150,000 for the burbot population in
the Kootenai River in Idaho, $300,000 for the Idaho sage grouse
management plan through the Idaho Office of Species
Conservation, $750,000 for sea otter research in Alaska, and
$50,000 for the Idaho Department of Agriculture to study the
influence of herbivory on slickspot peppergrass. In ESA
recovery, there are increases of $1,000,000 for the Atlantic
salmon program administered by the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation, $100,000 for salmon recovery in Maine, $1,000,000
for eider recovery at the Alaska SeaLife Center, $50,000 for
freshwater mussel recovery at the White Sulphur Springs NFH in
West Virginia, $500,000 for Lahonton cutthroat trout, $150,000
for wolf monitoring by the Nez Perce Tribe in Idaho, $75,000
for the Service's Snake River Basin office's wolf monitoring
efforts, and $250,000 for wolf monitoring efforts at the Idaho
Office of Species Conservation. There are also decreases in ESA
recovery of $1,000,000 for the Washington State salmon program
administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and a
$1,000,000 general decrease.
In habitat conservation, increases in the partners for
fish and wildlife program include $1,400,000 for the Washington
State regional salmon enhancement program, $700,000 for
invasive species control in Hawaii, $100,000 for bald eagle
restoration in cooperation with the Vermont Natural Heritage
Partners program, $400,000 for the Big Hole Watershed Committee
in Montana, $750,000 for the Hawaii ESA Community Conservation
Plan, $1,250,000 for the Nevada biodiversity research and
conservation project, $175,000 for the Thunder Basin grasslands
initiative in Wyoming, and $500,000 for the Montana Water
Center wild fish habitat initiative. Decreases in the partners
for fish and wildlife program include $500,000 for nutria
eradication at the Blackwater NWR, MD, $550,000 for bull trout
conservation in Washington State, $1,400,000 for the Washington
State ecosystems program, $1,000,000 for invasive species
control, and $300,000 for spartina control at Willapa Bay, WA.
In project planning, there are increases of $150,000 for
the Middle Rio Grande/Bosque research program and $474,000 for
wildlife assessments at Yukon Flats, AK.
In coastal programs, there is an increase of $750,000 for
the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association king salmon program in
Alaska and a decrease of $1,000,000 for cost shared projects,
including invasive species control.
There is a decrease of $500,000 for the environmental
contaminants program.
In refuge operations and maintenance, there is an
increase of $300,000 for invasive species control at the
Willapa NWR, WA and decreases of $1,000,000 for invasive
species control with friends groups and volunteers and
$5,000,000 for refuge maintenance.
In migratory bird management, there is an increase of
$575,000 to reduce seabird bycatch in Alaska, and decreases of
$1,000,000 for the Canada goose depredation program and
$1,000,000 for the joint ventures program. The funding level
for each joint venture is identical to that shown in the Senate
report.
In fisheries, there is a decrease of $500,000 for the
Washington State hatchery improvement project in hatchery
operations and maintenance. In fish and wildlife management,
increases include $300,000 for fish passage along railroads in
Alaska, $118,000 for fish surveys at the White Sulphur Springs
NFH, WV, $850,000 for wildlife enhancement in Starkville,
Mississippi, $400,000 for the Wildlife Health Center in
Montana, $2,403,000 for Yukon River treaty implementation in
Alaska, and $1,200,000 for marine mammal protection in Alaska.
Decreases in fish and wildlife management include $100,000 for
salmon reproductive biology research at Washington State
University, $1,000,000 for cooperative projects for fish
passage, and $1,000,000 for aquatic nuisance control.
In general administration, there are increases of
$200,000 for the Caddo Lake Ramsar Center in Texas and $550,000
for maintenance at the National Conservation Training Center
and a decrease of $1,000,000 for a National Academy of Sciences
review of the State Wildlife Grants program.
Within the increased funds above the fiscal year 2002
level provided for resource management, $5,000,000 is in
support of the Cooperative Conservation Initiative proposal.
These funds are targeted for existing programs that have a
proven record in leveraging funds and delivering valuable
resource restoration results. The $5,000,000 increase consists
of $3,000,000 for the refuge challenge cost share program,
$1,000,000 for invasive species control projects with refuge
friends groups and volunteers, and $1,000,000 for cooperative
fish passage projects.
The managers are very concerned by the proposed increase
in administrative costs charged to programs under the Service's
cost allocation methodology (CAM) without any justification for
these increases in the budget request. The managers expect that
the Service will charge no increase in CAM to programs in
fiscal year 2003 unless such increases are thoroughly justified
through the reprogramming process. The managers suggest that
any increase for CAM requested through the reprogramming
process be extremely modest.
The Service needs to do a better job of explaining CAM
and making it more transparent and readily understandable to a
wide audience. Costs that are directly attributable to
headquarters operations and regional office operations should
be budgeted under general administration for those operations
unless there is a clear and well-justified rationale for
inclusion in CAM. No unbudgeted special projects, headquarters
or regional initiatives, or departmental initiatives should be
included in CAM. If there is uncontrollable cost growth
associated with CAM it should be identified in the budget as a
fixed, uncontrollable cost increase and not funded at the
expense of programs.
The managers agree to the following:
1. The funds made available for Georgia stream bank
restoration are for the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation
Commission except that $25,000 is for technical assistance by
the Service.
2. The funds added for fish surveys at the White Sulphur
Springs NFH in West Virginia should remain in the base for
future budgets.
3. Funds have not been included for a National Academy of
Sciences review of State wildlife grants as proposed by the
House. This issue will be revisited in the fiscal year 2004
budget process.
4. The Service should continue to assist the Corps of
Engineers in its comprehensive review of alternative approaches
to preserving the Meadowlands wetlands area in northern New
Jersey. The conference agreement provides an increase of
$180,000 as proposed by the House for this purpose.
5. The Service should continue to support the Carhart
Wilderness Training Institute at the $200,000 level, which is
the same as in fiscal year 2002.
6. Within available funds, the Service should address the
needs of the Pittsford NFH, VT and Ouray NFH, UT.
7. The funds provided to combat whirling disease and
related fish health issues include $700,000 for the National
Partnership on the Management of Wild and Native Cold Water
Fisheries, $250,000 for resistant trout research coordinated
through the Whirling Disease Foundation, and $1,296,000 to
continue the National Wild Fish Health Survey, to expand
whirling disease investigations, and to recruit and train
health professionals.
8. The issue of continued operation of the airfield at
Midway Atoll NWR needs to be addressed immediately. There are
no funds in the Service's budget to continue to operate the
airfield for commercial aircraft purposes. If the parties who
benefit from the current airport certification are unwilling to
pay the additional expense associated with maintaining that
certification, the Service should scale back its operations to
include only those requirements necessary for refuge
operations, including maintaining a reasonable level of visitor
access.
9. The containment and cleanup of the recent spill of jet
fuel at Midway Atoll NWR should be addressed as quickly as
possible. The Service should keep the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations apprised of its efforts to address
this problem. The Department should consider submitting a
supplemental appropriations request to address this emergency
situation.
10. The Secretary recently re-chartered the Hanford Reach
National Monument Federal Planning Advisory Committee and
increased the number of committee members from 13 to 19. In the
interest of continuity and assuring timely completion of the
committee's work, the managers expect the Secretary to retain
the current members when appointing members to the committee.
The managers are concerned that replacement of the current 13
members would severely undermine the valuable work completed
thus far.
Bill Language.--While the total funding for the
endangered species-listing program is unchanged, the conference
agreement earmarks $6,000,000 for critical habitat designation
activities within the listing program instead of $5,000,000 as
proposed by both the House and the Senate. The managers
understand that the Department believes additional funding,
beyond that requested in the budget, will be needed for the
listing program in fiscal year 2003 and the managers
willconsider a supplemental request for additional funds if one is
submitted later this year.
CONSTRUCTION
The conference agreement provides $54,427,000 for
construction instead of $53,108,000 as proposed by the House
and $42,882,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds are to be
distributed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The managers continue to believe that the Service should
focus on providing on-the-ground refuge experiences for
visitors and modest visitor/education centers and visitor
contact stations. The maximum cost for any visitor center
should not exceed $3 million unless there are extreme,
extenuating circumstances, such as the high cost of materials
transport and construction in Alaska. The managers expect the
Service to treat the maximum amount as a true ceiling and not
the amount that every visitor center will cost. Also, visitor
contact stations should have a much lower maximum funding
level.
The managers agree to the following:
1. The balance of funding needed to complete the Bitter
Lake NWR visitor center in New Mexico and the Ohio River
Islands visitor center in West Virginia should be included in
the fiscal year 2004 budget.
2. This is the final year of funding for Kealia Pond
mitigation and restoration work in Hawaii.
3. The funds provided for kiosks on refuges should
provide for at least 20 of these structures, given that the
Service reports that the cost of each structure generally is
less than $50,000. The managers encourage the Service to use
standard designs and pursue cost sharing with friends groups
and others to leverage these funds to the extent possible.
LAND ACQUISITION
The conference agreement provides $73,370,000 for land
acquisition instead of $82,250,000 as proposed by the House and
$81,555,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds should be
distributed as follows:

LANDOWNER INCENTIVE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
The conference agreement provides $40,000,000 for the
landowner incentive program as proposed by the House instead of
$600,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement
also rescinds $40,000,000 in funds appropriated in fiscal year
2002 for this program because there has been a delay in
implementing this new program. The managers expect the Service
to make grant awards using the existing program applications.
STEWARDSHIP GRANTS
(INCLUDING RESCISSION)
The conference agreement provides $10,000,000 for
stewardship grants as proposed by the House instead of $200,000
as proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement also
rescinds $10,000,000 in funds appropriated in fiscal year 2002
for this program because there has been a delay in implementing
this new program. The managers expect the Service to make grant
awards using the existing program applications.
COOPERATIVE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND
The conference agreement provides $81,000,000 for the
cooperative endangered species conservation fund as proposed by
the Senate instead of $121,400,000 as proposed by the House.
The funds for habitat conservation plan land acquisition are
derived from the Land and Water Conservation Fund as proposed
by the House.
The managers encourage the Service to consider the
Potrero Creek project in California and the Black Capped Vireo
project in Texas if the project proposals are submitted and
rank within the range of high priority project proposals.
NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE FUND
The conference agreement provides $14,414,000 for the
national wildlife refuge fund as proposed by the Senate instead
of $19,414,000 as proposed by the House.
NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION FUND
The conference agreement provides $38,560,000 for the
North American wetlands conservation fund as proposed by the
Senate instead of $43,560,000 as proposed by the House.
Since the program is funded below the 2001 level, the
managers have not agreed to bill language, proposed by the
House, limiting increased grant funding above the fiscal year
2001 level to projects in the United States.
NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION
The conference agreement provides $3,000,000 for the
neotropical migratory bird conservation program instead of
$5,000,000 as proposed by the House and $2,000,000 as proposed
by the Senate.
MULTINATIONAL SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND
The conference agreement provides $4,800,000 for the
multinational species conservation fund as proposed by the
House instead of $4,200,000 as proposed by the Senate.
STATE AND TRIBAL WILDLIFE GRANTS
The conference agreement provides $65,000,000 for State
and tribal wildlife grants instead of $100,000,000 as proposed
by the House and $45,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within
this amount, $5,000,000 is for a competitive grant program for
Indian tribes as proposed by the House instead of $3,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement changes the title of this
account from ``State Wildlife Grants'' to ``State and Tribal
Wildlife Grants'' as proposed by the Senate and includes
statutory language permitting the merger of funds in the old
account with funds in the new account.
The Committee has not included $1,000,000 in the resource
management account as proposed by the House for a National
Academy of Sciences review of the State wildlife plans funded
under this account. This issue will be revisited in the 2004
budget process.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The conference agreement authorizes the use of $500,000
in previously appropriated funds for land acquisition of the
Great Salt Pond burial tract for the Narragansett Tribe as
proposed by the Senate. The House had no similar provision.
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
Operation of the National Park System
The conference agreement provides $1,565,565,000 for the
operation of the national park system instead of $1,605,593,000
as proposed by the House and $1,571,065,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement provides $344,227,000 for
resource stewardship. The change to the House level is a
reduction of $2,093,000 for uncontrollable costs. Within these
totals, an increase of $600,000 is provided for Vanishing
Treasures.
The conference agreement provides $319,128,000 for
visitor services. The change to the House level is a reduction
of $3,536,000 for uncontrollable costs.
The conference agreement provides $522,823,000 for
maintenance. Changes to the House level include decreases of
$3,837,000 for uncontrollable costs, $5,000,000 for cyclic
maintenance, $2,000,000 for condition assessments, $3,000,000
for repair and rehabilitation, and $1,000,000 for a strategic
business advisor.
The conference agreement provides $277,151,000 for park
support. Changes to the House level include decreases of
$2,562,000 for uncontrollable costs and $2,000,000 for the
challenge cost share program. The conference agreement retains
$5,000,000 for the challenge cost share program in support of
the Secretary's Cooperative Conservation Initiative. The
managers intend that one-third of the monies provided in the
base funding (before the increase for 2003) for the challenge
cost share program continue to be earmarked for trails.
Although the conference agreement includes a $6,000,000
undistributed reduction to park base operations, the managers
have also provided a $14,000,000 increase specifically for
park-based programs above the amount provided in the
President's budget.
Within the maintenance account, the managers earmark the
following projects: $233,000 for Bachlott House, $45,000 for
St. Mary's Museum at Cumberland Island NS, $400,000 for
historic structures at Great Smokey Mountains NP, $200,000 for
repairs at the Belle Haven Marina, $500,000 for the Wright
Brothers National Memorial in North Carolina, $170,000 for Fort
Piute at Mojave National Preserve and $300,000 for Gettysburg
NMP landscape restoration.
The managers concur with the concerns expressed by the
Senate with regard to both the rehabilitation and the annual
opening of the Going-to-the-Sun Road at Glacier National Park.
The managers have retained a general provision allowing for the
use of certain carryover funds for road rehabilitation, and
strongly encourage the Administration to include in its TEA-21
reauthorization proposal the resources necessary for complete
rehabilitation of the Road. The managers have also provided
additional resources to enhance spring opening operations.
While the managers understand that these additional resources
may not be entirely in place prior to the 2003 opening, the
Park should make every effort to implement the operational
changes promptly, or put in place appropriate interim measures
where necessary to expedite the opening of the road. In lieu of
the report required by the Senate, the Park should incorporate
into its annual road opening plan the operational changes
supported by the additional funds provided in this Act. The
plans for both 2003 and 2004 should be submitted to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations upon completion. The
managers further urge the Park to continue efforts to involve
the local community in the development of the annual opening
plan and the road opening process in general. The managers
appreciate the heightened attention given to these issues by
Park leadership.
The managers have not agreed to provide $750,000 for an
independent management, operational, performance and financial
review of Yellowstone National Park, as proposed by the Senate.
The Park is nearing completion of its business plan pursuant to
the Service's business plan initiative. The managers intend to
review carefully the information presented in that document,
and subsequently reconsider the need for an additional, more
comprehensive review. The managers are fully aware that there
are unmet needs within the Park, but remain concerned that
public comments by park staff do not reflect the substantial
additional resources provided to the Park in recent years. The
managers look forward to working with the Service to ensure
that these resources are being properly managed for the benefit
of the Park.
The managers direct that the superintendent of Yosemite
National Park renew, in such form as he deems appropriate,
permits or authorizations for stock use by recreational service
providers who were previously authorized by an appropriate
agreement or permit to provide such recreational activities and
services within the Park during 2002. These permits or
authorizations may be renewed for one year only and under the
same or similar terms and conditions as the activities and
services authorized for that entity in 2002. The Superintendent
shall not issue any such permit or authorization to any entity,
which he determines is not qualified to receive such
authorization based on past performance or present ability.
Within the funds provided, the managers encourage the
National Park Service to maximize and enhance the marketing of
historic sites of the French and Indian War with those of the
War for Independence campaign currently underway. The 250th
anniversary of the French and Indian War, spanning 2004-2010,
presents a significant opportunity to tell the story of
America's early history leading up to the Revolutionary War.
The character and capacity of leadership exhibited by men such
as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Daniel Morgan, Daniel
Boone, Adam Stephen, Charles Lee and Horatio Gates, was
profoundly influenced, and in some cases directly shaped, by
their experiences in the French and Indian War. By linking the
narratives of the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary
War, a unique opportunity is created to attract and engage
citizens and international visitors in developing a fresh and
meaningful understanding of how the values of liberty and
equality came to shape our nation.
The managers note that the District of Columbia has
developed plans for the design and construction of a Regional
Sports Complex at Kenilworth Park in northeast Washington, a
portion of which is owned by the National Park Service. The
site, an area of approximately 50 acres, was a District
landfill until the late 1960s when the landfill was capped.
The Service has conducted a preliminary assessment/site
investigation and a remedial investigation/feasibility study at
the site. The latter study is in draft and has been coordinated
with the District and EPA Region III. As a result of regulatory
review, the managers understand that the District has requested
a Human Health Risk Assessment from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and Region III of the Environmental
Protection Agency has made extensive comments that will result
in further investigations and require at least a year or more
to complete.
The managers direct the Service to work with the
Government of the District of Columbia, specifically the D.C.
Department of Recreation and the D.C. Sports and Entertainment
Commission, to develop a land use plan for the development of
Kenilworth Park that could be implemented in conjunction with
remediation, and to report the results of that effort to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than six
months after enactment of this Act. The managers recognize
that, before any plan can be implemented for this site,
environmental investigations and subsequent remediation must be
completed.
The Service is directed to provide level funding to the
Carhart Wilderness Training Institute.
The managers are concerned about a recent GAO report on
travel expenses, both domestic and international. The report
states that while $37-$50 million has been expended for travel
in each of the last four years, the Service could not give
specific information on the actual costs of domestic travel,
international travel or travel to conferences because it does
not routinely record these data. The Federal Travel Regulations
require that agency travel accounting systems capture certain
data, including travel type and purpose. The Service is not in
compliance with these regulations.
Over the last three years, travel has increased 29
percent, including a 60 percent increase in the Washington
office and a 32 percent increase in foreign travel--from 355
annual trips to 470 trips in fiscal year 2002. While the
managers understand that travel is a mission essential element,
the GAO study demonstrates that the Service does not have
sufficient controls in this area. With declining budgets, major
efficiencies should be achieved in this area, which would free
up needed resources for individual park units.
The managers expect the Service to comply with all the
GAO recommendations no later than September 30, 2003, and to
submit annually, by October 1 of each year, a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with detailed
data on domestic travel, international travel, and travel to
conferences. The data should be provided for the Washington
office and for each region.
UNITED STATES PARK POLICE
The conference agreement provides $78,431,000 for the
United States Park Police, the same as the House and the
Senate.
NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION
The conference agreement provides $61,667,000 for
national recreation and preservation, instead of $56,330,000 as
proposed by the House and $62,978,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement provides $552,000 for recreation
programs. Within the amount provided for natural programs, the
managers earmark $250,000 for the Northern Forest Canoe Trail.
The conference agreement provides $20,048,000 for
cultural programs. Changes to the House level include decreases
of $1,000,000 for National Register programs and $250,000 for
the Heritage Education Model in Louisiana. The Service is
directed to provide $250,000 for the Heritage Education Model
in Louisiana from within available funds. The agreement retains
$300,000 for Heritage Preservation, Inc.
The conference agreement provides $14,374,000 for
nationally designated Heritage Areas. Funds (excluding $119,000

The managers recommend $1,600,000 for the Apostle Islands
National Lakeshore for erosion control at the Outer Island
lighthouse. These funds, combined with remaining balances in
the planning account for this project, will complete the
erosion control work.
The managers did not retain funding for the following
projects, because the Service indicated that, for various
reasons, the funds could not be obligated in fiscal year 2003:
Badlands National Park, Cape Cod National Seashore, Craters of
the Moon National Monument, Mount Rainier National Park
(electrical system), Petrified Forest National Park and
Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful Inn project. The
managers will consider funding when these projects are ready to
move forward.
The monies provided for Arches National Park, Colonial
National Historical Park, Great Basin National Park, the
Hispanic Cultural Center, Japanese American History (building
640), Morristown National Historic Site, Cumberland Island
National Seashore (St. Mary's) and the National Underground
Railroad Freedom Center complete these projects.
The managers have included funding this year to construct
a new collections storage facility at Jamestown for Colonial
National Historical Park. The managers understand that the
current estimate for the next phase of the project, the
replacement visitor center, is approximately $7,600,000, and
strongly encourage the Service to include this component of the
Jamestown 400th anniversary celebration in the fiscal year 2004
budget request. The Service should manage the planning and
design for the visitor center project to remain within the
current cost estimate.
The managers have deferred funding for repair and
rehabilitation of Fort Washington, MD. The Service should
develop a comprehensive solution to address the issues at Fort
Washington, including identification of the priorities for
stabilization work. The Service is encouraged to include
funding for this project in the fiscal year 2004 budget, and
include a summary of the aforementioned plan in the budget
justification.
The managers have agreed to $200,000 for Fort McHenry, MD
for a development concept plan, not for construction design. It
is estimated that the DCP process will take about a year to
complete. The DCP will look at site alternatives, as well as
concepts. The project will be submitted by the park for
consideration within the NPS five-year planning process. There
have not been any private partnership commitments yet, although
a fundraising agreement is in place. Private fundraising
efforts are not anticipated to begin until the DCP is
completed. The managers strongly urge the park to downscale its
expectation for a $14 million visitor center. The park should
work closely with the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations on the size and cost of the facility, as well as
private funding commitments, before additional funds are
provided for this project.
The managers have included funding to initiate planning
on three proposed visitor center projects. Because of concerns
about the projected scope of these projects, and the need to
address increased funding to reduce the deferred maintenance
backlog, the managers are providing specific direction to limit
the size and gross cost of these facilities, as follows;
$3,500,000 for a new visitor facility at Washita National
Battlefield, $4,000,000 for Grand Portage National Monument,
and $4,500,000 for Homestead National Historic Site. Planning
costs should be limited to 10% of the amounts listed above,
consistent with the NAPA guidelines. The Service should provide
an update to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on its revised approach and its progress on these projects by
May 1, 2003.
The managers have provided $395,000 for Thomas Stone
NHS--$300,000 to stabilize the East Wing and $95,000 to make a
gravel parking lot ADA compliant. The managers have provided
$500,000 under the operation of the national park system
account for upgrades at the Wright Brothers National Memorial
in North Carolina. The $400,000 for Eleanor Roosevelt NHS is
for park restorations only as specified in the House report.
The managers have provided planning funds for a proposed
educational center to be constructed at Fort Osage in Missouri.
The managers want to ensure that the scope and cost of the
project are appropriate, given the visitation at the site, and
that the project includes a significant private cost share. The
managers urge the project sponsors and the Service to provide
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with a final
plan for construction, which scales the project appropriately
and which provides a significant non-Federal cost share before
additional funds will be provided.
The Administration has requested funding for the
construction of security structures at the Washington Monument,
and Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials in Washington, D.C. The
Congress has previously provided language that would expedite
the contracting process for these facilities so that
construction could begin in the late summer of 2002 in
accordance with the schedule provided by the Service. The
managers now understand that the planning, review and clearance
processes have delayed the start of construction for the
Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial projects (by a full
year). As a result of these delays, funds requested for these
projects are no longer needed in fiscal year 2003. The managers
direct the Administration to include funding for these projects
in the fiscal year 2004 construction request.
The managers are aware of the partnership project between
the National Park Service and the Valley Forge Historical
Society to contract and operate a National Center for the
American Revolution at Valley Forge National Historical Park.
Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into
an agreement for this partnership in Public Law 106-86, but
made no financial commitment to the construction of the
project.
While the partnership may provide opportunities to
improve the care of important Revolutionary War era collections
and enhance the educational opportunities afforded to visitors
at the park, the planning for this facility must proceed
cautiously. The project sponsors need to recognize the
budgetary constraints facing all levels of government, as well
as recent decreases in philanthropic giving. With these
concerns in mind, the managers expect the National Park Service
to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
on a reasonably scaled vision for the Center, with commitments
for non-Federal cost share, no later than June 1, 2003. Future
funding for this project is unlikely if the Service does not
prioritize it as part of its five-year line-item construction
program.
Within the funds provided for General Management
Planning, the Service is directed to complete the EA for the
Mt. Vernon Trail and a new area study for Great Falls National
Park and to support the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park
general management plan consistent with Senate guidance.
The managers have provided $7,500,000 to enhance the
capacity of the Service to execute the infrastructure program.
The managers expect that not more than 50 percent of these
funds be used to hire staff in the regional offices. The
balance should be used for contractor support. A report on the
use of these funds should be provided to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
The managers are concerned with the number of partnership
projects pursued by the National Park Service, but not
prioritized by the agency nor considered in the establishment
of the five-year line-item construction program. While
partnerships are important in enhancing the public appreciation
and understanding of the mission of all of the agencies funded
in the Interior appropriations bill, the Federal commitment
associated with such partnerships cannot be considered separate
and apart from other demands for funding.
The managers are troubled by the growing number of
partnership projects for which the non-Federal partner pursues
funding through the appropriations process. Increasingly, if
these partnership projects receive funding, it will be as a
trade-off against priorities identified in the agency budget
request. Thus, it is important that agencies evaluate the
priority these partnerships receive vis-a-vis the program
requirements prioritized in the budget request, as well as the
vast needs that don't make it into the budget each year.
The President and the Congress have made a significant
commitment to addressing the deferred maintenance backlog of
the National Park Service, and every public dollar pursued for
partnership projects involving new facilities means one less
dollar dedicated to reducing the backlog. In addition, funding
for the operational requirements of the National Park Service
continues to be a significant concern, and pressure to provide
increased funding for large construction investments will
result in reduced capacity to address operational needs. If
partnership projects are a priority for the Administration,
then consideration should be given to adjusting the priority-
setting process for line-item construction to allow for their
competition along with deferred maintenance and other projects.
The funds provided for equipment replacement include
funds to implement PMIS package #90252 regarding snow removal
and related activities for Going-to-the-Sun Road at Glacier
National Park. The managers expect that $500,000 will be used
for replacement boats at Isle Royale National Park.
Land and Water Conservation Fund
(RESCISSION)
The conference agreement rescinds the contract authority
provided for fiscal year 2003 by 16 U.S.C. 4601-10a as proposed
by both the House and the Senate.
Land Acquisition and State Assistance
The conference agreement provides $172,468,000 for land
acquisition and State assistance instead of $253,099,000 as
proposed by the House and $204,005,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Funds should be distributed as follows:

The managers have not provided funding for Ebey's Landing
NHR and Piscataway Park because there are presently no options
to purchase land. The managers will be pleased to consider
future funding requests.
The Secretary should acquire the Bayliss property at
Cedar Creek and Belle Grove NHP that is now owned by the Cedar
Creek Battlefield Foundation for an amount equal to the balance
due on the current deed of trust on the property but no more
than $368,000. The Secretary shall use funds from the National
Park Service's hardship account to acquire the property.
Upon completion of a new appraisal of Cat Island, MS, the
Service should complete the first phase of the purchase using
funds provided for Gulf Islands National Seashore, together
with other available funds if necessary.
The managers are aware of the concerns of the residents
of the 8.5 Square Mile Area regarding the plan to implement
section 104 of the Everglades National Park Protection and
Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. 410r-8), called ``Alternative
6D.'' This plan requires the acquisition of additional homes.
To minimize disruption in the lives of these residents and to
make them whole again, if the United States must take their
property to proceed with implementation of Alternative 6D, the
conference agreement allows the Corps to acquire additional
residential property only if these residents are offered the
opportunity to relocate to comparable land within the 8.5
Square Mile Area. This means that the residents of the 8.5
Square Mile Area who choose to relocate within that area must
be offered land of equal or greater size, suitable under all
applicable land use regulations for use that is the same as the
actual use of the land on which they currently reside and
eligible for all necessary permits required for such use. The
managers also expect the financial assistance provided to such
residents will allow them to build a replacement home of equal
size, including costs of moving and temporary living
arrangements during a reasonable period of time for design and
construction. The managers understand that Federal funding in
the amount of $6,000,000 has previously been appropriated and
provided to the South Florida Water Management District for the
purpose of acquiring replacement residential property. The
language in the conference agreement also clarifies that this
directive is not intended to stop the Alternative 6D project
from moving forward.
The language, specifically the text of subsection (b)
(1), does not require the Corps of Engineers or the non-Federal
sponsor to complete a relocation before completing a land
acquisition, once the offer required by subsection (b) (1) is
made. Such offers and land acquisitions may be made and
completed in accordance with a schedule determined by the Corps
of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor and need not proceed
sequentially.
Administrative Provisions
The managers have retained the House language regarding
the United Nations Biodiversity Convention.
UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Surveys, Investigations, and Research
The conference agreement provides $925,287,000 for
surveys, investigations, and research instead of $928,405,000
as proposed by the House and $914,617,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
There is a decrease below the House for the national
mapping programs of $1,000,000 for Internet access.
The managers recognize the need to implement The National
Map for the Nation's urban areas. These urban areas are the
home to more than 160 million citizens, located in areas
subject to many natural hazards, such as coastal storms and
wildland fires. The managers believe it is important to have
up-to-date information available to Federal, State, and local
governments, the private sector, and the public for emergency
response. The managers recommend that the Survey continue its
efforts to develop and implement The National Map, keeping the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations apprised of its
progress and future plans through its budget submissions.
Changes to the House for geology programs include
increases of $1,000,000 for volcanic hazard equipment in
Shemya, Alaska, $1,500,000 for the minerals at risk program
which completes this project, $500,000 for the coastal erosion
program, North Carolina, and decreases of $500,000 for the
coastal program, $299,000 for Lake Mead/Hoover Dam, $500,000
for the cooperative geological mapping program, $1,200,000 for
EPCA studies, and $500,000 for the geothermal program.
Changes to the House for water resources include
increases of $200,000 for the Berkeley Pit study in Montana,
$299,000 for the Lake Champlain toxic materials studies,
$500,000 for Hawaiian water monitoring, $220,000 for an algae
bloom study in Hawaii, and $195,000 for the Noyes Slough study
in Alaska, and decreases of $1,000,000 for the Mexico border
initiative, $580,000 for the Long-Term Estuary Group, $400,000
for the Water Resources Research Institutes, $500,000 for toxic
substances, and $105,000 for the Southern Maryland aquifer
study.
Within the funds provided for water resources, $1,000,000
is earmarked for the Long-Term Estuary Assessment program.
Funds have not been included for the Rathdrum Prairie/
Spokane Valley aquifer study as proposed by the Senate. The
managers are supportive of the project generally, but
understand that the required State or local matching funds have
not yet been secured nor has an agreement been reached among
all interested parties, including the Survey, detailing the
scope and collaborative nature of the work. The managers would
be willing to reconsider the project at a future date provided
these issues are resolved.
Increases above the House for biological research include
$750,000 for the continuation of the Mark Twain National Forest
mining study, $180,000 for the Yukon Flats salmon study,
$500,000 for the Pallid Sturgeon study, $100,000 for the
terrapin study in Maryland, $1,000,000 for a DNA bear study in
Montana, $300,000 for a water study at the Leetown Science
Center, $500,000 for Lake Tahoe decision support and decreases
of $800,000 for the fire science program, $500,000 for
amphibian research, $1,000,000 for NBII nodes, $500,000 for the
cooperative research units uncontrollable costs, and $18,000
for travel and transportation.
The managers have supported the establishment of the NBII
to improve access by Federal agencies, States, universities,
and others to biological data and to promote information
sharing. The managers have provided significant funding
increases to NBII in recent years but are concerned about an
apparent lack of direction and budget accountability. These
concerns need to be resolved before additional funding
increases can be considered.
Therefore, the managers direct the Survey to prepare a
strategic plan outlining the prioritized vision for the network
including details and a time line on all new nodes, expansions
of existing nodes, the costs associated with each node, and all
other projects that are part of the NBII program. The plan
should explicitly address national and international
objectives.
The plan should address how the existing and planned
network relates to the Survey's overall strategic and
programmatic goals for enhanced data sharing. The Survey should
provide information on the potential for cost sharing and how
NBII relates to existing, non-Federal data networks such as
Natureserve. As part of the strategic planning process, the
managers would like to see peer-review comments from leading
biologists and informatics specialists that are not associated
with the current NBII partnership.
Finally, the report should show accomplishments to date
for each node, listing national and international
accomplishments, a list of partners involved, and how each
accomplishment supports the biological goals for the Survey and
the Department. The report should specifically address which
NBII accomplishments support USGS science centers and Interior
land management agencies. This information should be provided
to the Committees by April 30, 2003.
There is a decrease below the House for science support
of $1,635,000 for accessible data transfer.
Changes to the House for facilities include an increase
of $375,000 for the Leetown Research Center expansion, and a
decrease of $200,000 for the Tunison laboratory.
The managers support strongly Survey partnerships with
coalitions of institutions that maintain a strong emphasis on
collaborative research, Federal-State partnerships, and public-
private partnerships. Wherever possible, the managers encourage
the Survey to co-locate at these institutions when this
furthers the goals of the Survey, the Department, and the
Administration.
The managers encourage the Survey and the General
Services Administration (GSA) to continue to work towards
completion of a satisfactory plan for relocating the Survey's
Western programs to more adequate space. They are aware that
one of the most promising options is a 30-year build-to-suit
lease for facilities located on land at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. The managers believe that GSA and the
Survey should try to reach agreement on the lease if it is in
the best interest of the Survey, the science programs, and is a
cost effective option.
Administrative Provisions
The managers have made technical changes to the bill
language proposed by the House to make it easier for the Survey
to co-locate its facilities.
MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE
Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management
The conference agreement provides $165,321,000 for
royalty and offshore minerals management instead of
$164,721,000 as proposed by the House and $164,322,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Changes to the House for royalty and offshore minerals
management include increases of $800,000 for the Center for
Marine Resources, and $800,000 for the Marine Mineral
Technology Center in Alaska, and a decrease of $1,000,000 for
the information management program.
The managers have again provided $1,400,000 to the
Offshore Technology Research Center to perform critical mission
research for MMS through the cooperative agreement dated June
18, 1999.
Within the funds provided for royalty and offshore
minerals management $150,000 is earmarked for the Alaska
Whaling Commission.
Oil Spill Research
The conference agreement provides $6,105,000 for oil
spill research as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Regulation and Technology
The conference agreement provides $105,367,000 for
regulation and technology as proposed by the House and the
Senate. Funding for the activities and budget instructions
should follow the House recommendation. The managers understand
that the administration's proposal to give a special allotment
of grants to West Virginia is no longer needed. Instead, the
allocation of grants to States should follow the normal
methodology.
ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND
The conference agreement provides $191,745,000 for the
abandoned mine reclamation fund as proposed by the Senate
instead of $184,745,000 as proposed by the House. Funding for
the activities and budget instructions should follow the Senate
recommendations. The managers have also included the Senate
proposed bill language included in previous years concerning
certain aspects of the State of Maryland program.
BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
Operation of Indian Programs
The conference agreement provides $1,857,319,000 for the
operation of Indian programs instead of $1,859,064,000 as
proposed by the House and $1,855,635,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
Decreases below the House for tribal priority allocations
include $1,120,000 for new tribes and $2,000,000 for welfare
assistance.
Increases above the House for other recurring programs
include $2,000,000 for tribally controlled community colleges,
$50,000 for Western Washington Bolt, $15,000 for Great Lakes
resource management, $100,000 for the Alaska Sea Otter
Commission, $800,000 for the Bering Sea Fisherman's
Association, $146,000 for the bison program, $350,000 for the
Chugach Regional Resources Commission, and $320,000 for the
upper Columbia River tribes, and decreases of $2,000,000 for
ISEP formula funds, $1,000,000 for student transportation,
$1,900,000 for facilities operation and maintenance, $4,000,000
for administrative cost grants, and $441,000 for the timber,
fish and wildlife program.
The funding increase included for the Chippewa/Ottawa
Resource Authority is to be allocated equally between the
Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians and the Little River
Band of Ottawa Indians.
Increases above the House for non-recurring programs
include $1,500,000 for the distance learning program in
Montana, $750,000 for the Rural Alaska fire program, $50,000
for the North Dakota Department of Agriculture's fire
assistance program in Sioux County, and $350,000 for attorney
fees, and decreases of $200,000 for the Navajo/Hopi settlement
program and $314,000 for the endangered species program.
Increases above the House for special programs and pooled
overhead include $200,000 for the Law Institute for American
Indians, $100,000 for the United Sioux Tribes Development
Corporation, $500,000 for the Alaska native aviation training
program, $1,000,000 for the Yuut Elitnavuviat learning center,
$1,000,000 for the Western Heritage Center Distance-Learning
and Training Program, and $2,000,000 for detention center
staffing.
The managers do not understand the disparate treatment of
Crownpoint Institute of Technology and the United Sioux Tribes
Technical College related to contract support. Unless there is
an objection by the Navajo Nation to Crownpoint being treated
as a tribal organization, the managers expect the Bureau to
provide this funding under a P.L. 93-638 contract and include
contract support.
The managers direct the Bureau to develop a study dealing
with child abuse and child welfare. This study should detail
the adverse effects of child abuse on American Indians and
Alaska natives. As part of the study the Bureau should provide
recommendations for reducing incidents of child abuse including
the potential for developing cost-shared pilot projects with
tribal organizations, States, and non-profit organizations. The
Bureau should provide this study to the Committees by April 30,
2003.
The managers do not concur with the Senate report
language directing the Bureau to establish a service area for
the Samish Indian Nation. Currently this issue is being
litigated, and the Department of the Interior is in settlement
discussions with the tribe. The managers believe that this
process is the appropriate avenue for resolving these issues.
Bill language has been included under operation of Indian
programs to allow the use of ISEP contingency funds to cover
the expenses of negotiated rulemaking required by the No Child
Left Behind Act.
Construction
The conference agreement provides $348,252,000 for
construction as proposed by the Senate instead of $345,252,000
as proposed by the House.
The managers have provided a $3,000,000 increase above
the House for the tribal school construction demonstration
program.
Language has been included under Title I general
provisions authorizing a tribal school construction
demonstration program through fiscal year 2007.
INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIM SETTLEMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENTS TO
INDIANS
The conference agreement provides $60,949,000 for Indian
land and water claim settlements and miscellaneous payments to
Indians as proposed by the House instead of $57,949,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Indian Guaranteed Loan Program Account
The conference agreement provides $5,493,000 for the
Indian guaranteed loan program as proposed by the House and
Senate.
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES
Insular Affairs
ASSISTANCE TO TERRITORIES
The conference agreement provides $76,217,000 for
assistance to territories instead of $73,217,000 as proposed by
the House and $75,217,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
managers have agreed to Compact impact assistance funding out
of the technical assistance activity of $3,000,000 for Hawaii
and $1,000,000 for Guam. The managers have also included the
$1,000,000 recommended by the House for U.S. Virgin Islands
court mandated infrastructure needs and $1,000,000 for the
Prior Service Trust Fund. The managers agree with the House
direction to the Interior Department concerning a new, long-
term solution to the Prior Service Trust Fund financing problem
and with Senate direction for a Federal-local financing plan
for the U.S. Virgin Islands. This latter report should be
submitted by April 30, 2003. The managers also direct that the
CNMI local matching requirement for fiscal year 2003 capital
improvement grants be waived due to the extensive damage caused
by supertyphoon Pongsona.
COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION
The conference agreement provides $20,985,000 for the
Compact of Free Association instead of $21,045,000 as proposed
by the House and $20,925,000 as proposed by the Senate. This
includes a total of $1,631,000 for Enewetak support. The
increase above the request is for repairs to the shipping
vessel which provides food to Enewetak.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $72,427,000 for
departmental management as proposed by the Senate instead of
$57,533,000 as proposed by the House. Changes to the House
include increases of $15,000,000 to restore funds cut on the
House floor, $400,000 for Departmental Direction and a decrease
of $506,000 for Central Services.
The managers encourage the Federal partners responsible
for the Great Lakes Visitor Center, WI, to increase funding for
the center in fiscal year 2003, especially for important
initiatives such as its environmental education program.

of inspector general, the same as the House and the Senate.
NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides no funds for salaries
and expenses of the National Indian Gaming Commission as
proposed by the Senate instead of $2,000,000 as proposed by the
House.
Language has been included under Title I general
provisions increasing the fees available to the National Indian
Gaming Commission from $8,000,000 to $12,000,000 beginning in
fiscal year 2004.
The Commission is directed to consult with tribal
governments on both the development, pursuant to section 18 of
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2717), of a new fee
schedule resulting from increasing the fee cap from $8,000,000
to $12,000,000, and on the regulations published at 67 Federal
Register 41166 (June 17, 2002). The managers concur that not
more than $120,000 of the funds available to the Commission be
used for this consultation process.
OFFICE OF SPECIAL TRUSTEE FOR AMERICAN INDIANS
FEDERAL TRUST PROGRAMS
The conference agreement provides $141,277,000 for
Federal trust programs as proposed by the House instead of
$151,027,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The managers once again express their reservations about
funding for the historical accounting project. The managers
have provided an increased level of funds over the fiscal year
2002 enacted level for historical accounting. However, the
managers remain very concerned about appropriating hundreds of
millions of dollars for this project at the expense of other
high priority programs in this bill, including other Indian
programs. The managers believe that it is more important to fix
prospectively the trust systems thereby allowing the Secretary
to continue to meet her trust and fiduciary responsibilities to
Indian country.
The managers have modified the bill language for the
Office of Special Trustee for American Indians noting that of
the funds provided $15,000,000 is for the historical
accounting.

TITLE II--RELATED AGENCIES
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Forest Service
FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH
The conference agreement provides $251,685,000 for forest
and rangeland research instead of $252,000,000 as proposed by
the House and $247,804,000 as proposed by the Senate. Changes
to project funding from the House bill include: an increase of
$2,000,000 for Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), a decrease
of $850,000 for the advanced housing research consortium, a
reduction of $500,000 for adelgid and insect research in the
east, an increase of $1,500,000 for sudden oak death research,
an increase of $500,000 for the global climate change program,
a decrease of $4,165,000 for fixed costs, an increase of
$500,000 for invasive species research, $500,000 for the Joe
Skeen Institute for Rangeland Restoration, and an increase of
$200,000 for Baltimore, MD, urban watershed research.
The managers agree to the following more specific
direction for the above items:
1. The managers provide $500,000 for the development of
carbon sequestration rules and protocols as part of the Climate
Change Initiative.
2. The managers direct $500,000 for expanded research in
the control and management of pests and pathogens, including
hemlock woolly adelgid, to the forest science laboratory at
Morgantown, West Virginia. The managers expect these funds to
address high priority work throughout the northeast.
3. The managers provide $200,000 to the Northeastern
Research Station for high priority research associated with the
Urban Watershed Forestry Research and Demonstration Cooperative
in Baltimore, Maryland, as part of the program direction for
Revitalizing Baltimore and the Baltimore Ecosystem Study.
4. The managers encourage the Forest Service to work with
the Mississippi Institute for Forest Inventory in order to
further the goals of the FIA program and the Institute.
5. The managers direct the Forest Service to prepare a
strategic plan with a national focus that will demonstrate how
the agency intends to address the spread of sudden oak death.
This strategic plan should consider the proper balance between
the allocation of research and eradication resources and how
these resources can best be coordinated within the Forest
Service as well as with other Federal, State, and local
entities.
State and Private Forestry
The conference agreement provides $286,574,000 for State
and private forestry instead of $279,828,000 as proposed by the
House and $297,472,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement provides, as proposed by the
House, $50,374,000 for Federal lands forest health management,
$31,038,000 for cooperative lands forest health management, and
no funding for the proposed emerging pest and pathogens fund.
The managers agree with the concept of withholding some forest
health funding from immediate distribution to address new
problems that may emerge during the year, but the managers feel
that far greater management efficiency and flexibility will
exist if a new account is not created. The agreement includes
bill language proposed by the House which clarifies that
funding in this account should be used for the treatment of
invasive or noxious plants. The managers have moved the
$300,000 proposed by the Senate for leafy spurge control in the
Dakota Prairie grasslands to the national forest system
account. The cooperative lands forest health management
activity includes the $300,000 proposed by the Senate for
Vermont forest monitoring and a total of $1,700,000 for sudden
oak death control. These funds should be allocated primarily to
States with the most severe outbreaks of sudden oak death.
Funding proposed by the Senate under this heading for sudden
oak death research has been moved to the forest and rangeland
research account.
The conference agreement includes $25,653,000 for State
fire assistance instead of $25,353,000 as proposed by the House
and $25,853,000 as proposed by the Senate, the change from the
House proposal being an increase of $300,000 for Cook Inlet
Tribal Council, AK, spruce bark beetle management. The agency
shall follow Senate direction concerning distribution of these
funds. The agreement also includes $5,040,000 for volunteer
fire assistance as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
The conference agreement also includes additional funds for
State fire and volunteer fire assistance as part of the
national fire plan funding within the wildland fire management
account.
The conference agreement includes $32,221,000 for forest
stewardship as proposed by the Senate instead of $36,898,000 as
proposed by the House. Changes from the House proposal are
increases of $250,000 for the Chesapeake Bay program and
$300,000 for Utah forestry education; there is a general
decrease of $5,227,000. The managers note that an additional
$20,000,000 is available for similar activities in the forest
land enhancement program (FLEP) from mandatory farm bill funds.
The managers direct the Forest Service to show clearly in all
future budget justifications within the text for State and
private forestry how mandatory funding for FLEP, provided in
the farm bill, will be allocated and how this funding relates
to forest stewardship activities.
The conference agreement includes $68,827,000 for the
forest legacy program instead of $60,000,000 as proposed by the
House and $74,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference
agreement retains bill language proposed by the House requiring
notification to the Appropriations Committees when the Forest
Service makes funds available for specific forest legacy
projects. The conference agreement also includes bill language,
modifying language proposed by the House, stipulating that
forest legacy grants must be for specific projects or for
specific tasks undertaken when a State joins the program. In
addition, the conference agreement has modified the bill
language proposed by the House concerning the need for a 25%
cost share of the total value of each project. The managers
concur that the Forest Service should require that a minimum
25% cost share must be secured over the life of each grant.
The conference agreement also includes bill language,
which gives the State of Maine until January 31, 2004 to
complete the West Branch project. If this project is not
completed by this date, the entire amount previously
appropriated for this project, $20,013,145, shall be
transferred to the Forest Service wildland fire management
account and be made available for the highest national priority
rehabilitation and restoration projects. The managers expect
that the final West Branch project will include a substantial
fee ownership for the State of about 47,000 acres and that
there will also be completed a conservation easement to the
Forest Society of Maine, or similar group, of about 282,000
acres.
The conference agreement directs the Forest Service to
follow the House proposed direction for the forest legacy
program, with the following exceptions:
1. The managers concur with the House language requiring
the Forest Service to submit a five-year legacy program
strategy but the strategy should articulate the forest legacy
program's national goals, objectives, performance measures, and
the issues and trends affecting forests in regions across the
country. This strategy should also provide a national
perspective for the forest legacy program and assist States in
contributing to national and regional conservation needs. The
managers further direct that the Forest Service revise and
finalize its Forest Legacy Program Implementation Guidelines by
June 30, 2003. The revised guidelines should include definitive
guidance regarding project definition, cost shares, monitoring,
appraisals, and other areas of concern noted in the Committee's
report, dated June 14, 2002.
2. The managers are concerned with the manner in which
the cost share is calculated for legacy projects. Rather than
requiring a 25% cost share for each project before a grant may
be awarded as proposed by the House, the managers concur that
the Forest Service should require that a minimum of 25% of the
total cost share of each project should come from non-Federal
sources over the course of the grant period and that each
project grant must document the total value of the project's
non-federal cost share. The Forest Service shall strictly
comply with existing Office of Management and Budget Circulars
concerning matching requirements for federal grants.
3. The managers recognize that given the often complex
and lengthy nature of negotiations for the purchase of
conservation easements, the agency may submit a request for
project funding in its budget justification, which only
specifies a geographical area rather than a specific tract.
However, the managers will not appropriate funds for such
projects until the agency has identified the specific tracts to
be purchased.
4. The managers concur that, to the greatest extent
possible, legacy easements should provide for public access but
the managers also recognize that there may be reasons why such
access is impractical because of natural resource or public
safety concerns. The managers expect the agency to indicate to
the Committees in advance when an easement will not provide for
public access and the reasons why such access is inappropriate.
5. The managers are concerned that forest legacy program
managers may not be able to use the Forest Service's official
financial accounting system, the Foundation Financial
Information System (FFIS), to manage forest legacy funds due to
the system's limitations. The managers direct the Forest
Service to ensure that FFIS contains accurate and complete
expenditure information for forest legacy grants and that it
supports program management information requirements. The
managers concur with the House proposal concerning the need to
track the status of individual projects, to require separate
grants for each project, and to use a single grant
authorization and payment system for the forest legacy program.
However, the managers understand that the FFIS system may not
be able to manage information in this fashion. If so, the
managers expect the agency to develop and have fully
operational, an independent system which is capable of
performing these functions by the close of the fiscal year.
6. The conference agreement includes new State start-up
funds only for Alaska and Idaho, although the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations will carefully consider other
States for inclusion in the program in future years.
The conference agreement includes the following
distribution of funds for the forest legacy program:

Total, Economic Action............................   $26,440,000
The conference agreement includes $5,000,000 for the
economic recovery program as proposed by the House and
$4,000,000 for rural development through forestry, but does not
establish specific regional allocations for the Pacific
Northwest or the northeast-midwest as was proposed by the
Senate. Rather, the Forest Service should carefully consider
these regions when allocating grants in these activities. The
conference agreement includes the bill language proposed by the
Senate concerning a direct lump sum payment to the Kake Tribal
Corporation, AK, but the funding total is $1,000,000. The funds
provided to the City of Valdez for avalanche control work shall
be in the form of an advance, direct lump sum payment. The
funds for Little Sandy River shall be provided to Clackamas
County, OR, to perform the work.
The conference agreement includes $4,996,000 for forest
resource information and analysis as proposed by the Senate and
$5,750,000 for the international forestry program.
National Forest System
The conference agreement provides $1,362,299,000 for the
national forest system instead of $1,370,567,000 as proposed by
the House and $1,352,999,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds
should be distributed as follows:
Land management planning................................   $72,195,000
Inventory and monitoring................................   175,356,000
Recreation, heritage & wilderness.......................   254,194,000
Wildlife & fish habitat management......................   133,806,000
Grazing management......................................   40,850,000
Forest products.........................................   265,353,000
Vegetation & watershed management.......................   190,944,000
Minerals and geology management.........................   52,635,000
Landownership management................................   93,016,000

Valles Calderas National Preserve, NM...................    3,150,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total............................................. $1,362,299,000
The following discussion describes funding changes from
the House passed bill.
1. The land management planning activity does not include
a special allocation for the Black Hills National Forest, SD.
2. The inventory and monitoring activity includes an
increase of $50,000 for Lake Tahoe basin adaptive management.
Inventory and monitoring funding includes $6,200,000 for the
Forest Inventory and Analysis program as directed by the House.
3. The recreation activity includes: $350,000 for
environmental analysis of helicopter flights on the Tongass
National Forest, Juneau district; an increase of $64,000 above
the House proposal for the Carhart Wilderness Training
Institute, bringing its total funding to $300,000; and a
reduction of $664,000 for fixed costs. The managers direct the
Forest Service to issue a contract for $350,000 with the City
of Juneau, AK to prepare an environmental impact statement to
identify ways to mitigate the impacts of helicopter charter
flights in the Tongass National Forest on the community of
Juneau, AK. The managers encourage the federal partners
responsible for the Great Lakes Visitor Center, WI, to increase
funding for the center in fiscal year 2003, especially for
important initiatives such as its environmental education
program.
4. The wildlife and fish habitat management activity
includes the Senate proposed increase of $250,000 for the
Batten Kill River, VT, and a reduction of $392,000 for fixed
costs.
5. The grazing management activity is provided
$40,850,000, an increase of $6,075,000 above the enacted level.
This increase should be used to provide range monitoring and
updated allotment management plan analysis.
6. The forest products activity includes the Senate
proposed earmark of $4,000,000 for Tongass National Forest
timber sales preparation out of base funds.
7. The vegetation and watershed management activity
includes the general decrease proposed by the Senate of
$3,790,000 and increases of: $1,450,000 for the Lake Tahoe
basin; $305,000 for Mark Twain National Forest pine
restoration, MO; $300,000 for Wasatch Canyon water quality
initiative, UT; $135,000 for Monongahela National Forest
hydrology study, WV; and $300,000 for leafy spurge control on
the Dakota prairie, ND. The Forest Service is encouraged to
work with the Canaan Valley Institute, WV, on watershed
projects.
8. The minerals and geology activity is increased
$1,000,000 above the House proposal and the landownership
management activity is reduced $4,000,000 from the House
proposal.
9. The law enforcement activity has a general decrease of
$592,000. The managers encourage the Forest Service to evaluate
carefully the funding for law enforcement activities on
national forests in Georgia, especially areas impacted by high
use.
10. The Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, is funded
at the Senate proposed level. The managers have provided all
funding for the Valles Caldera in this account. The conference
agreement has modified bill language proposed by the Senate
concerning senior executive service salary for the chairman of
the board of the preserve. The agreement now allows SES salary
to continue only for the chairman of the board.
The $5,000,000 general reduction to this account passed
on the House floor is not agreed to nor is the bill language
(reducing and increasing funding) in order to make a change to
grazing management. The agreement does include bill language
allowing fund transfers to the BLM for cadastral surveys.
The conference agreement includes a total of $8,400,000
from all appropriation accounts for the Land Between the Lakes
National Recreation Area, KY and TN.
The managers allow the Forest Service, upon notification
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, to
reprogram national forest system funds within the Lake Tahoe
basin.
The managers reiterate the House direction to the Forest
Service to reestablish an active challenge cost share program.
This program should be coordinated with the Department of the
Interior's similar efforts.
Wildland Fire Management
The conference agreement provides $1,379,938,000 for
wildland fire management instead of $2,013,449,000 as proposed
by the House and $1,351,791,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
managers note that the conference agreement also includes
$636,000,000 under a separate division as proposed by the
Senate to reimburse a portion of wildfire suppression costs
incurred during emergencies in fiscal year 2002 rather than a
contingent emergency appropriation of $500,000,000 as proposed
by the House. The agreement also includes $420,699,000 for
suppression operations as proposed by both the House and the
Senate and $616,000,000 for preparedness, a reduction of
$24,000,000 from the House recommendation.
The managers are concerned that the allocation of funds
between preparedness and suppression operations mentioned above
and in summary tables may not maintain the levels of readiness
needed for public safety that were established in fiscal years
2001 and 2002. The managers also feel that decisive action is
necessary to manage escalating fire suppression costs. An
important component of reducing such costs is maintaining
initial attack capability so that more fires can be contained
before they escape and cause serious loss of life and property
as well as natural resource damage. Accordingly, the managers
direct the Forest Service to analyze current readiness levels
to determine whether maintaining preparedness resources in the
field at a level not less than that established in fiscal year
2002, will, based on the best information available, result in
lower overall firefighting costs. If the agency makes such a
determination, the managers direct the Forest Service to adjust
the levels for preparedness and suppression funding accordingly
and these adjustments shall have the advance approval from the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Forest
Service should advise the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations in writing of their decision.
Because of the managers' continuing concern regarding
fire suppression costs during major incidents, the Forest
Service and the Department of the Interior are directed to
contract with the National Academy of Public Administration for
appropriate follow-up work to their study of 2002. The
Departments should equally share the cost of the review and the
review should be conducted forthwith.
OTHER WILDFIRE OPERATIONS
The conference agreement includes $343,239,000 for other
fire operation activities instead of $452,750,000 as proposed
by the House and $330,389,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
allocation of this funding is as follows:
Total
Hazardous Fuels.........................................  $228,109,000
Fire Facilities.........................................    1,850,000
Rehabilitation..........................................    7,124,000
Research & Development..................................   21,427,000
Joint Fire Science......................................    8,000,000
Forest Health Management federal........................    6,955,000
Forest Health Management cooperative....................    9,979,000
Economic Action.........................................    5,000,000
State and community fire assistance.....................   46,555,000
Volunteer fire assistance...............................    8,240,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total other wildfire operations...................  $343,239,000
The conference agreement includes $228,109,000 for
hazardous fuels treatments as proposed by both the House and
the Senate. Changes from the House proposed funding in this
activity are increases of $550,000 for the Lake Tahoe basin,
$1,000,000 for the Santa Fe watershed, NM, and a general
decrease of $1,550,000. The conference agreement does not
include specific bill language in this account as proposed by
the House allowing transfer of funds to the Interior and
Commerce departments for endangered species consultations.
Rather, the agreement includes the similar Senate proposal
under administrative provisions as discussed below.
The managers note that the Department of the Interior and
the Department of Agriculture have begun full implementation of
the 10-Year comprehensive strategy to reduce wildland fire
risks. This strategy involves extensive collaboration with
communities in the selection of hazardous fuels projects. In
support of the strategy, the Departments have developed
detailed criteria for the execution of such hazardous fuels
reduction efforts. The managers feel that collaboration with
communities and the use of criteria for project selection
provide a suitable basis for planning the expenditure of funds,
and accordingly do not concur with Senate report language
requiring that seventy percent of hazardous fuels funds be used
in the wildland urban interface.
Although the conference agreement does not include the
bill language proposed by the Senate concerning the county
partnership restoration program in AZ, NM and CO, the managers
agree that this is an important program and that the Forest
Service should continue to provide funding for it from the
hazardous fuels allocation.
The conference agreement includes $1,850,000 for wildfire
management facilities instead of $20,376,000 as proposed by the
House and no funding proposed by the Senate. This allocation
includes $1,200,000 for the Medford, OR airtanker base and
$650,000 for the Pinhook, FL wildfire station. Specific House
instructions on these two projects should be followed.
The conference agreement includes $7,124,000 for
rehabilitation and restoration activities instead of
$63,000,000 as proposed by the House and $6,124,000 as proposed
by the Senate. This funding includes $2,500,000 for
rehabilitation activities on the Apache-Sitgreaves National
Forest, AZ, as recommended by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $21,427,000 for
research and development activities as proposed by the Senate
instead of $27,265,000 as proposed by the House. Changes from
the House proposal include an increase of $1,000,000 for the
University of Montana landscape analysis center and $200,000
for the related University of Idaho project and a $7,038,000
general program decrease.
The conference agreement includes $6,955,000 for federal
forest health activities and $9,979,000 for cooperative forest
health activities. The managers expect the Forest Service to
increase its forest health capabilities at Asheville, NC as
described in the House report. The managers have included
$46,555,000 forState and community fire assistance as proposed
by the Senate instead of the $58,000,000 House recommendation. Of the
funds provided for State fire assistance, $4,200,000 shall be provided
to the Municipality of Anchorage and $1,000,000 shall be provided to
the Matanuska-Sustitna Borough to perform work in areas affected by the
spruce bark beetle. The agency shall follow Senate direction with
respect to the distribution of these two allocations.
The conference agreement includes $5,000,000 for economic
action activities associated with the national fire plan
instead of $12,500,000 as proposed by the House and no Senate
funding. Volunteer fire assistance receives $8,240,000 as
proposed by the Senate instead of $8,500,000 as proposed by the
House.
Capital Improvement and Maintenance
The conference agreement provides $552,039,000 for
capital improvement and maintenance instead of $572,731,000 as
proposed by the House and $543,656,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The conference agreement provides for the following

The managers agree with the overall program direction for
this account provided by both the House and the Senate. The
conference agreement includes bill language proposed by the
House continuing the authority to use funds for road
decommissioning and includes Senate proposed language
concerning a previous appropriation for improvements at Purdue
University, IN, for the hardwoodscience center. The agreement
also allows further direct payments to Purdue University for that
project and to Cordova, Alaska for a shared visitor center.
Furthermore, the managers reiterate that funding for the Chugach
visitor center in Cordova, AK, shall be the final amount provided by
the Forest Service, and the Forest Service should be given a share of
the space proportional to its funding of the construction cost. As
proposed by the House, the conference agreement does not provide any
funding for the Juneau-ANM, AK, building and associated roads. The
managers have included $400,000 for the Pinhoti trail in AL and GA;
this funding should be approximately evenly split between the two
States. The conference agreement includes a total of $5,000,000 for the
Forest Service to address fish passage barriers. The Forest Service
should follow the House direction on this activity, but since the
funding has been reduced, this funding should focus on activities in
regions 6 and 5, which would benefit salmonid fish.
Land Acquisition
The conference agreement provides $133,815,000 for land
acquisition instead of $146,336,000 as proposed by the House
and $145,763,000 as proposed by the Senate. Funds should be
distributed as follows:

Forest land acquisition for a direct payment to the City of
Juneau, AK.
Acquisition of Lands for National Forests Special Acts
The conference agreement provides $1,069,000 for the
acquisition of lands for national forests special acts as
recommended by both the House and the Senate.
Acquisition of Lands to Complete Land Exchanges
The conference agreement provides an indefinite
appropriation estimated to be $234,000 for the acquisition of
lands to complete land exchanges as proposed by both the House
and the Senate. The conference agreement also includes a minor
change in bill language to clarify that the Forest Service has
authority to use donated funds.
Range Betterment Fund
The conference agreement provides an indefinite
appropriation estimated to be $3,402,000 for the range
betterment fund as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Gifts, Donations and Bequests for Forest and Rangeland Research
The conference agreement provides $92,000 for gifts,
donations and bequests for forest and rangeland research as
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Management of National Forest Lands for Subsistence Uses
The conference agreement provides $5,542,000 for
management of national forest system lands for subsistence uses
in Alaska as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Administrative Provisions, Forest Service
The managers have retained bill language proposed by the
Senate, which continues to prohibit the use of funds to abolish
or move regional offices without Appropriations Committee
approval. The conference agreement retains the House proposed
bill language which allows funds to be transferred to the
wildland fire management appropriation only after funds in that
account are obligated. The agreement allows the Forest Service
to advance up to $3,000,000 to the National Forest Foundation
and the Foundation may use up to $400,000 for administrative
costs. The agreement also includes the House proposal to make
the language concerning the Pinchot Institute for Conservation
valid through fiscal year 2007. The conference agreement
includes language, which allows employees of the senior
community service employment program to be considered federal
employees while on the job at the Forest Service. The
conference agreement also includes the Senate proposals on: the
use of funds for law enforcement emergencies; the sale of
facilities on the Green Mountain National Forest, VT; and the
transfer of up to $15,000,000 to reimburse the Departments of
the Interior and Commerce for endangered species act
activities.
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
The managers have not agreed to the budget amendment,
which would fund a new National Climate Change Technology
Initiative at the expense of important, ongoing research in
other areas. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations
will consider a reprogramming request for this new program
should one be submitted and contain acceptable offsets.
Clean Coal Technology
(DEFERRAL)
The conference agreement provides for the deferral of
$87,000,000 in previously appropriated funds for the clean coal
technology program instead of $50,000,000 as proposed by the
House and $70,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. These funds
will become available on October 1, 2003, to complete the
remaining projects in this program.
The managers agree that up to $15 million in prior year
funds may be used for administration of the clean coal
technology program in fiscal year 2003.
Fossil Energy Research and Development
The conference agreement provides $624,900,000 for fossil
energy research and development instead of $664,205,000 as
proposed by the House and $625,665,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The numerical changes described below are to the House
recommended level.
In central systems, there is a decrease of $3,000,000 in
innovations for existing plants for mercury research and, in
advanced systems, there are decreases of $4,500,000 for the
integrated gasification combined cycle program and $1,700,000

administration.
Finally, there are increases of $3,000,000 for a
consolidated cooperative program with the States and $5,000,000
for the energy efficiency science initiative.
The managers agree to the following:
1. Within the funds provided for the windows program, the
Department should consider increasing funds for the National
Fenestration Rating Council database.
2. Within the funds provided for off-highway engine
research, the Department should consider emissions reduction
research, locomotive research, and fuel cell applications for
off-road vehicles.
3. The Department recently established a five-year
agreement with the National Association of State Energy
Officials (NASEO) and the Association of State Energy Research
and Technology Transfer Institutions (ASERTI) to implement a
State Technologies Advancement Collaborative. The Department,
through this collaborative, should use the resources of NASEO
and ASERTI to implement the consolidated cooperative program
with the States and the consolidated energy efficiency science
initiative.
4. As mandated in the fiscal year 2002 Interior
Appropriations Act, half of the funds for the energy efficiency

energy information administration as proposed by the House
instead of $80,111,000 as proposed by the Senate.
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
Indian Health Service
INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES
The conference agreement provides $2,492,115,000 for
Indian health services instead of $2,508,756,000 as proposed by
the House and $2,455,881,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
numerical changes described below are to the House recommended
level.
For hospital and health clinic programs, there are
increases of $230,000 for the Ketchikan Native Corporation and
$4,435,000 to restore administrative reductions proposed in the
budget request and decreases of $6,788,000 for the Indian
health care improvement fund, $1,500,000 for the Lawton, OK
hospital, $500,000 for epidemiological centers, and $500,000
for the Alaska telemedicine program.
For contract health services, there is a decrease of
$5,000,000. For Indian health professions there is an increase
of $95,000 for the recruitment and retention of American
Indians into nursing (RAIN) program at the University of North
Dakota and a decrease of $4,150,000 for recruitment programs.
For direct operations, there is an increase of $4,436,000 to
restore administrative reductions proposed in the budget
request. For the self-governance program, there is an increase
of $4,500,000. Finally, there is a decrease of $11,899,000 for
annuitant health care payments for Public Health Service
personnel.
The managers agree to the following:
1. The direction in the House report should be followed
with respect to the distribution of the Indian Health Care
Improvement Fund. The Service should report to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations on the distribution on
funds.
2. The increased funding proposed by the House for
staffing and operations at the Lawton Hospital in Oklahoma will
be phased in over two years. The $1,500,000 increase provided
in fiscal year 2003 should remain in the base budget for fiscal
year 2004 and an additional $1,500,000 should be added in 2004.
3. Unless specifically identified to the contrary, any
increases above the fiscal year 2002 level for the direct
operations activity shall be used by the Indian Health Service
for inherently Federal functions.
4. Payments required as the Service's portion of
Departmental initiatives should be included in the budget as
uncontrollable funding increases and not applied as across-the-
board health program reductions.
5. The Service should carefully review its use of funds
under the self-governance activity.
6. Any Departmental efforts to consolidate functions or
restructure or realign programs that affect the Indian Health
Service must be approved through the reprogramming process by
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to
implementation.
7. Within the fiscal year 2003 budget there is $250,000
for the InPsych program at the University of Montana and
$250,000 for the InPsych program at the University of North
Dakota, $750,000 for the INMED program at the University of
North Dakota, $1,000,000 for the dental program run by First
Nations Community Health Sources in cooperation with the
Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute in the Albuquerque, New
Mexico area, and $3,500,000 for the Telehealth Initiative in
Alaska.
8. The direction in the Senate report with respect to the
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is no longer necessary.
The conference agreement provides a statutory earmark of
$18,000,000 for the catastrophic health emergency fund as
proposed by the Senate instead of $15,000,000 as proposed by
the House. The statutory earmark for other contract health
services is $460,130,000 instead of $468,130,000 as proposed by
the House and $450,130,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conference agreement also permits funds, provided to new tribes
through the contract health services activity, to be used for
direct medical services in addition to contract care. The
Service began funding new tribes from the contract health
services account several years ago and it was never the intent
of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to limit
new tribes funding to contract health care only.
The ceiling for the loan repayment program is $25,000,000
instead of $22,000,000 as proposed by both the House and the
Senate. The managers expect that this increase will permit the
service to increase the amount made available to recruit
dentists, pharmacists, podiatrists, and other critical health
professionals.
The conference agreement includes bill language that
extends the availability of funds under the Special Diabetes
Program for Indians so that these funds remain available until
expended. The managers note that funding for this program was
recently increased substantially and encourage the Service to
use the additional funds to strengthen its national clinical
data system so that data from programs may be tracked
comprehensively and outcomes reported with confidence. While
IHS has made strides over the past five years, there remains
significant room for improvement. The Service should also use
the additional diabetes funds for a competitive grant program
that addresses the most compelling diabetes complications in
American Indians and Alaska Natives and addresses primary
prevention of diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives
using the latest scientific findings on this subject. These
competitively awarded projects should demonstrate new
approaches to dealing with diabetes and related health
complications. The managers also encourage the Service to
expand participation in diabetes education and prevention for
Native American youth through the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America.
Finally, bill language is included that directs
$5,000,000, of the $15,000,000 provided to the Alaska
Federation of Natives for alcohol control, prevention,
treatment, sobriety and wellness, be made available to the
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium for substance abuse and
behavioral health counselors through the Counselors in Every
Village Program.
INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES
The conference agreement provides $376,190,000 for Indian
health facilities instead of $391,865,000 as proposed by the
House and $365,390,000 as proposed by the Senate. The changes
to the House level include an increase of $156,000 for
facilities and environmental health support and decreases of
$2,500,000 for maintenance and improvement, $156,000 for
sanitation facilities, and $1,000,000 for equipment. For
hospital and clinic construction, there are increases of
$2,100,000 to complete the Pinon, AZ clinic and $308,000 for
the Metlakatla, AK clinic and decreases of $4,000,000 for the
Fort Defiance, AZ hospital, $5,583,000 for the St. Paul, AK
clinic, and $5,000,000 for small ambulatory care facilities.
The managers agree to the following distribution of
facilities construction funds (excluding sanitation
facilities):
Conference
Project                        agreement
Fort Defiance, AZ (complete hospital)...................   $16,400,000
Pinon, AZ (complete clinic).............................   16,000,000
Winnebago, NE (complete hospital).......................    8,241,000
Red Mesa, AZ (clinic construction)......................    7,653,000
Pawnee, OK (complete clinic)............................   12,633,000
Sisseton, SD (clinic construction)......................    3,000,000
St. Paul, AK (clinic construction)......................    5,584,000
Metlakatla, AK (clinic construction)....................     308,000
Clinton, OK (clinic design).............................    1,300,000
Bethel, AK quarters (complete)..........................    5,000,000
Small ambulatory care facilities........................    5,000,000
Dental units............................................    1,000,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   $82,119,000
The managers agree to the following:
1. The decrease to the House level for the Fort Defiance
Hospital still provides sufficient funds to complete this
project, which will be constructed for less than the previous
estimate.
2. Any Departmental efforts to consolidate functions or
restructure or realign programs that affect the Indian Health
Service must be approved through the reprogramming process by
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to
implementation.
3. Fiscal year 2003 funding for the small ambulatory
facilities program may be used to select projects from the rank
order list generated from the fiscal year 2001 application
process. A new request for proposals should be issued if funds
are made available for this program in fiscal year 2004.
4. Savings from completed health care facilities
construction projects may be used to continue high priority
projects currently on the Service's health care facilities
construction priority lists. In fiscal year 2003, $5,000,000
should be made available for the Metlakatla, AK Clinic and
$3,000,000 should be made available for renovations at the
Lawton, OK Hospital.
The conference agreement includes bill language proposed
by the Senate prohibiting the use of funds for sanitation
facilities construction associated with new homes funded
through Department of Housing and Urban Development grants. The
House addressed this issue in report language. Bill language
also is included permitting the Service to use up to $1,000,000
to purchase ambulances as proposed by the Senate instead of up
to $500,000 as proposed by the House. The language has been
modified to permit the use of either services funding or
facilities funding for this purpose.

improvements at the National Zoo and the Office of Protection
Services, and $945,000 to restore in full the general
offsetting reduction of $12,795,000 proposed in the budget
request. The House had provided the bulk of these funds,
$11,850,000, in its initial recommendations. The Senate, in
agreement with the Administration, had accepted the reduction
in full. There is a decrease of $250,000 for research
activities at the Tropical Research Institute, which still
provides an increase of $500,000 above the budget request for
those programs.
The managers are aware that there has been confusion in
recent years regarding the Smithsonian Institution's
eligibility to compete for grants at the National Science
Foundation. This problem was recently identified as a
significant issue in the National Academy of Public
Administration's review of Smithsonian science programs
released in October 2002. The Appropriations Committees are
concerned that this confusion has persisted despite recent
internal NSF policy directives clarifying that the Smithsonian
is fully eligible to compete for National Science Foundation
grants. The managers urge the Secretary of the Smithsonian to
work with the Director of the National Science Foundation to
make sure that Smithsonian grant applications are welcomed by
all programs at the Foundation and given fair consideration
with all other applications based on the merits of the
proposals.

Forest Service by non-profit recreational camps, which are
operated by organizations such as the Girl Scouts and church
groups. A new fee structure is needed so that these important
uses of the public lands are encouraged and not excluded due to
new appraisal methods. This new fee system allows camps to
remain on national forest system lands while providing a fair
and equitable return to the American taxpayer.

DIVISION G--LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND
RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS 2003
In implementing this agreement, the Departments and
agencies should follow the language and instructions set forth
in the explanatory statement of the Managers in the Senate
accompanying H.J. Res. 2 that appears in the Congressional
Record of January 15, 2003. With respect to the provisions in
the Senate explanatory statement that specifically address the
allocation of funds, each has been reviewed by the conferees
and those that are jointly concurred have been endorsed in this
joint statement.
In the cases where the Senate explanatory statement
requests a report, the conferees are agreed that departments
and agencies have up to 90 days beyond the due date specified
in the Senate explanatory statement to submit the report.
The conferees are aware of several instances during the
past year where the Departments funded in the Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act have failed to consult with, or timely notify, the House
and Senate Appropriations Committees about significant
budgetary actions and the reorganization of departmental
offices, programs, and activities. Moreover, some Departments
have become too lax in responding to the requests for
information or reports from the Committees. The conferees
believe that timely, accurate and complete information is
critical in order for the Appropriations Committees to meet
their oversight responsibilities. The conferees fully expect
that the Departments funded in this bill will be more
responsive to the Committees in this regard.
Therefore, the conferees concur with language included in
the explanatory statement of the Senate regarding reprogramming
and the initiation of new programs. The conferees direct that
the Departments and agencies funded through this Division make
a written request to the chairmen of the Committees prior to
the reprogramming of funds in excess of 10 percent, or
$500,000, whichever is less, between programs, activities, or
elements unless an alternate amount for the agency in question
is specified elsewhere in this Division of this statement. The
conferees further agree that a reprogramming request is
required for actions involving less than the above-mentioned
amounts if such actions would have the effect of changing an
agency's funding requirements in future years or if the action
can be construed to be the initiation of a new program.
Second, the conferees reiterate that the Committees be
notified regarding reorganization of offices, programs, or
activities prior to the planned implementation of such
reorganizations.
Third, the conferees request that each Department
institute a tracking system for reports requested by the
Committees in order to ensure their timely submission.
Finally, the conferees concur with language in the
explanatory statement of the Senate that statements on the
effect of this division of this appropriation Act be submitted
to the Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003, put
in place by this resolution, incorporates the following
agreements of the managers:
TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
Employment and Training Administration
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The conference agreement includes $5,218,070,000 for
training and employment services instead of $5,138,513,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and $5,120,084,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Of the amount appropriated, $2,463,000,000 is an
advance appropriation for fiscal year 2004, as proposed by H.R.
246 and the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $1,000,965,000 for
Youth Training, which is the Senate level. Funding for the
Youth Opportunity Grants, $44,500,000, provided within the
total for this activity in H.R. 246, is provided separately in
the conference agreement as proposed by the Senate. These
grants are aimed at increasing the long-term employment of
youth who live in empowerment zones, enterprise communities,
and other high-poverty areas.
The conference agreement includes $1,463,770,000 for the
Dislocated Worker program instead of $1,484,500,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246 and $1,383,040,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees override the formula that provides that 80 percent of
the funds provided will be used for State formula grants and 20
percent for National Emergency Grants, providing $1,157,162,000
for the States and $306,608,000 for the National Reserve.
Within the National Reserve, the conference agreement includes
$30,000,000 to fund National Emergency Grants authorized in the
Trade Act of 2002 to support State administration of health
insurance tax credits for eligible participants.
The conference agreement includes $56,000,000 for Native
Americans instead of $55,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and
$57,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $77,836,000 for
activities authorized under Section 167 of the Workforce
Investment Act, reflected in two separate line items on the
table accompanying the Conference Report: ``Migrant and
Seasonal Farmworkers'' and ``National Activities/Other''. Under
the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers line item, the agreement
provides $77,326,000. The conference agreement includes bill
language directing that $4,640,000 of this amount be used for
migrant and seasonal farmworker housing grants. This agreement
also provides that the remaining amount be used for State
service area grants, including funding grantees in those States
impacted by formula reductions at no less than eighty-five
percent of the comparable 1998 levels for such States. Within
the National Activities/Other line item, the conference
agreement includes $510,000 to be used for Section 167
training, technical assistance and related activities,
including continuing funding for migrant rest center activities
at the current level.
The conference agreement includes $1,518,550,000 for Job
Corps. Within the total, $1,391,000,000 is provided for
continuing operations of the program and $127,550,000 is for
renovation and construction of Job Corps centers. The conferees
are pleased with the prompt attention given by the Department
to developing the selection process for new Job Corps centers.
The conferees intend that the Department shall give priority to
communities in major metropolitan areas that demonstrate strong
linkages with local school systems, post-secondary education
systems, employers, faith-based and community organizations and
child care facilities. In an effort to maximize the U.S.
taxpayer's investment in Federal programs, priority should also
be given to sites that incorporate co-location models that may
include Job Corps along with programs such as Head Start and
State or local community colleges and vocational technical
schools. Additionally, priority should be given to sites that
have high numbers of at-risk youth and currently export the
majority of their State's eligible students to Job Corps
centers in other States and regions.
The conferees are aware of the controversy over the
accuracy of financial reporting under the Workforce Investment
Act, and intend to carefully monitor the spending situation,
recognizing the vital role of the workforce system at a time of
economic slowdown.
With respect to the projects listed below for pilots and
demonstrations, the conferees encourage the Department to
ensure that theseprojects are coordinated with local Workforce
Investment Boards. The conferees also encourage the Department to
ensure that project performance is adequately documented and evaluated.

The conference agreement includes bill language to limit
the amount available for Federal tort claims within community
health centers funding to not more than $40,000,000 instead of
$25,000,000 proposed by H.R. 246 and $50,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate.
The conference agreement includes bill language
identifying $275,138,000 for family planning instead of
$265,275,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $285,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $1,514,651,000 for
community health centers instead of $1,533,570,000 as proposed
by the Senate and $1,457,864,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The
conferees concur withlanguage contained in the Senate
explanatory statement that not less than $9,000,000 be provided for
Native Hawaiian health care activities.
The conferees have provided an increase above the request
for community health centers in order to continue the
initiative to add health center sites and expand services while
also allowing increased grant support to existing centers for
economic stabilization and to offset the rising cost of current
services. While many health centers may be very efficient
providers of services, they are not immune from the cost
increases faced by all health care providers. Further, health
centers are facing additional cost pressures as a result of the
rising number of people without health insurance. For these
reasons, the conferees expect HRSA to use a portion of the
increased funding to increase basic support for existing health
centers based on performance-related criteria, in addition to
site and service expansion applications.
The conferees direct HRSA to provide a report to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than
September 30, 2003 regarding the methodology used in
distributing fiscal year 2003 health center appropriations and
the methodology intended to be used in fiscal year 2004,
including the actual and intended division of funds among new
or expanded sites, service expansions, and adjustments to help
cover the increased cost of ongoing services, as well as the
formula or other methodology used in allocating the portion
intended to help cover increased costs.
The conference agreement includes $46,249,000 for the
national health service corps field placements instead of
$46,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $46,498,000 as proposed
by the Senate. The conferees support the Student Resident
Experiences and Rotations in Community Health (SEARCH) program
within the national health service corps and intend that HRSA
continue this program in fiscal year 2003.
The conference agreement includes $125,959,000 for
national health service corps recruitment instead of
$109,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $142,918,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees intend that $3,000,000 of
this amount be designated for the chiropractic program
authorized under section 338L of the Public Health Service Act.
The conference agreement includes $423,961,000 for health
professions instead of $392,582,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and
$424,066,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees intend that the graduate psychology
education program be continued within the funds provided for
allied health and other disciplines, and that a geropsychology
graduate training program be established within allied health.
The conferees provide $28,000,000 for geriatrics
education. Within the total provided, $16,800,000 is directed
to geriatric education centers, $6,500,000 is designated for
geriatric training programs, and $4,700,000 is directed to
geriatric academic career awards.
The conferees agree with the Senate explanatory statement
directing HRSA to fund training components of chiropractic
demonstration grants.
Within the funding for health professions training, the
conference agreement provides $113,502,000 for nurse training
programs instead of $98,502,000 proposed by H.R. 246 and
$118,502,000 proposed by the Senate. The conferees have
appropriated funding to establish programs authorized under the
Nurse Reinvestment Act (P.L. 107-205), renamed existing line
items to reflect these new authorities, and added new line
items to fund these programs. The conferees have relabeled
``Basic Nurse Education and Practice'' the ``Nurse Education,
Practice, and Retention Grants'' and relabeled the ``Loan
Repayment Program'' the ``Loan Repayment and Scholarship
Program'' to reflect the additional authorities provided under
Sections 831 and 846, respectively, of the Public Health
Service Act as modified by P.L. 107-205. In using the increase
in funding provided above the fiscal year 2002 level, the
conferees expect HRSA to give preference in funding to
internship and residency programs (Sec. 831(a)(2)), career
ladder programs (Sec. 831(c)(1)), and enhancing patient care
delivery systems (Sec. 831(c)(2)) as required under Sec. 831(e)
of the PHSA. The conferees have provided funding for
scholarships (Sec. 846 (d)) for nursing students in exchange
for service as a nurse for at least two years at a health care
facility with a critical shortage of nurses. The conferees have
also appropriated funding to establish the Nurse Faculty Loan
Program and Comprehensive Geriatric Education, Sections 846A
and 855 of the PHSA. The Nurse Faculty Loan Program will help
increase the number of faculty at schools of nursing.
Comprehensive Geriatric Education will train and educate
individuals in providing geriatric care for the elderly. The
conferees intend that nurse loan repayment funding should be
directed to high priority urban and rural areas with severe
nursing shortages.
The conference agreement does not include funding within
HRSA for the Healthy Communities initiative. H.R. 246 proposed
$10,000,000 for the program and the Senate proposed
$20,000,000. Additional funds have been provided to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention for this purpose.
The conference agreement includes $734,741,000 for the
maternal and child health block grant instead of $726,931,000
as proposed by H.R. 246 and $741,531,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement includes bill language
designating $115,900,000 of the funds provided for the block
grant for special projects of regional and national
significance (SPRANS). Neither H.R. 246 nor the Senate bill
earmarked funds for this purpose. It is intended that
$4,000,000 of the SPRANS amount will be used to continue the
sickle cell newborn screening program and its locally based
outreach and counseling efforts. In addition, $5,000,000 of the
SPRANS amount will be used for oral health demonstration
programs and activities in the States as described in the
Senate explanatory statement, $500,000 will be used for the
city of Milwaukee Health Department for a pilot program
providing health services to at-risk children in day care, and
$10,000 will be used for the Dane County Neighborhood Child
Health Clinic in Madison, Wisconsin to provide child dental
services.
The conference agreement includes bill language
identifying $55,000,000 for abstinence education instead of
$60,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $40,000,000 as proposed
by the Senate.
The conferees note that abstinence messages to a group of
youth by a grantee should not be diluted by any instructor or
materials from the same grantee. Adolescents should not be
discouraged from seeking health information or services. HHS
should not preclude entities who are teaching abstinence-only
classes and who have a public health mandate from discussing
other forms of sexual conduct or providing services, as long as
this is conducted in a different setting from the abstinence-
only course. In allocating grant funds, HRSA should give
priority to those organizations that have a strong record of
support of abstinence education as defined in sections (a)
through (h) of Title 5, section 510(b)(2) of the Social
Security Act.
The conference agreement includes $98,989,000 for healthy
start as proposed by the Senate instead of $94,811,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees recognize the life-saving success of the
National Marrow Donor Program. In light of the new nuclear and
chemical threats facing the country, the conferees encourage
the National Marrow Donor Program to increase its public health
preparedness efforts by developing and maintaining a national
emergency response plan to ensure an adequate supply of needed
marrow and blood stem cells. The conferees also support the
National Marrow Donor Program's efforts to expand the sources
of blood stem cells through its work on a cord blood bank
initiative. The conferees encourage the NMDP to focus on the
following areas: (1) recruitment of donors, with an emphasis on
minority donors; (2) enhancement of cord blood banks through
increased recruitment efforts,research, and other cord blood
bank support; and (3) expansion of the NMDP's role in research related
to improving outcomes of patients who receive bone marrow transplants.
The conference agreement includes $58,500,000 for rural
health outreach grants instead of $38,385,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $51,472,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conference agreement includes the following amounts for the

hand, from those in the U.S. who are most
experienced in AIDS care............................     200,000
The conferees continue to be concerned about the health
care needs of those in the Mississippi River Delta region. The
conferees provide $6,800,000 for rural health outreach to
continue the ongoing initiative in eight States. These grants
provide funding and technical assistance to help underserved
rural communities identify and better address their health care
needs and to help small rural hospitals improve their financial
and operational performance. The conferees further recommend
that HRSA consult with the Delta Regional Authority and the
Delta Health Alliance, given their ongoing relationships with
communities in the Delta.
The conference agreement provides $10,700,000 for rural
health research instead of $16,808,000 as proposed by the
Senate and $9,190,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees include the following amounts for the

The conference agreement provides $8,500,000 for State
offices of rural health instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate and $4,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes $27,500,000 for the
Denali Commission instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. H.R. 246 contained no similar provision. The conferees
reinforce language in the Senate explanatory statement
indicating that the Denali Commission should allocate funds to
a mix of service facilities.
The conference agreement includes $19,500,000 for
emergency medical services for children instead of $18,000,000
as proposed by H.R. 246 and $20,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conference agreement includes $22,500,000 for poison
control instead of $20,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and
$24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $9,500,000 for
traumatic brain injury instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $9,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $3,499,000 for trauma
care instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246
contained no similar provision.
The conference agreement includes a total of
$2,031,005,000 for Ryan White programs, of which $25,000,000 is
provided through the evaluation set-aside, instead of
$1,930,204,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $2,051,295,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Included in this amount is $622,741,000
for emergency assistance, $1,060,285,000 for comprehensive
care, $199,672,000 for early intervention, $74,032,000 for
women, infants, children, and youth, $13,493,000 for dental
services, and $35,782,000 for education and training centers.
The conference agreement includes bill language
identifying $719,000,000 for the Ryan White Title II State AIDS
drug assistance programs instead of $659,000,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $739,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conference agreement also includes bill language making
available $25,000,000 under section 241 of the Public Health
Service Act to carry out Ryan White Special Projects of
National Significance as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 had
no similar provision.
The conferees intend that at least 90 percent of total
title IV funding be provided to grantees. With the exception of
funds provided through the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the
conferees expect the funding increase to be used primarily to
support maintenance of existing care services because of the
rising costs of providing comprehensive care and the
implementation of quality management programs. The conferees
intend that HRSA use a significant portion of the remaining
funds to expand comprehensive services for youth. The conferees
are pleased by current efforts to facilitate ongoing
communication with and among grantees about the administration
of title IV programs and expect the agency to expand these
efforts. The conferees request the agency to work with grantees
to develop effective title IV-specific site visit
methodologies.
Some 5 percent of the funds appropriated under this
section may be used to provide peer-based technical assistance.
Within this amount, sufficient funds are available to maintain
and expand work being done to create a national consumer and
provider education center on the use of various strategies in
the care of children, youth, women and families infected with
or affected by HIV and AIDS.
Within the total provided, $131,200,000 is for Ryan White
AIDS activities that are targeted to address the growing HIV/
AIDS epidemic and its disproportionate impact upon communities
of color, including African Americans, Latinos, Native
Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific
Islanders. The conferees expect HRSA to follow the fiscal year
2002 House report regarding the disbursement of these funds.
Consistent with this overall direction, these funds are
allocated as follows:
Emergency assistance--Within the total provided,
$43,800,000 is for competitive, supplemental grants to improve
the HIV-related health outcomes for communities of color and
reduce existing health disparities.
Comprehensive care programs--Within the total provided,
$7,000,000 is for State HIV care grants to support educational
and outreach services to increase the number of eligible
minorities who access HIV/AIDS treatment through AIDS Drug
Assistance Programs (ADAP).
Early intervention program--Within the total provided,
$53,400,000 is for planning grants and Early Intervention
Service (EIS) grants to health care providers with history of
serving communities of color.
Pediatric demonstrations--Within the total provided,
$18,500,000 is to sustain and expand efforts to deliver
comprehensive, culturally competent and linguistically
appropriate research-based intervention and HIV care services
to minority women, infants, and children.
Education and training centers--Within the total
provided, $8,500,000 is to increase the training capacity of
centers to expand the number of community-based minority health
care professionals with treatment expertise and knowledge about
the most appropriate standards of HIV/AIDS-related treatments
and medical care for HIV infected adults, adolescents and
children.
The conference agreement provides $292,000,000 for
children's hospitals graduate medical education as proposed by
H.R. 246 instead of $285,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $120,000,000 for the
community access program as proposed by H.R. 246 instead of
$120,027,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within the total
provided, $105,000,000 is for grants to develop and expand
integrated systems of care and address service gaps within such
integrated systems. The conferees intend to permit these funds
to be available both for new Healthy Communities Access Program
grants under the new section 340 of the Public Health Service
Act, as well as renewal (to the extent appropriate based on
programmatic considerations) of grants initially made during
fiscal years 2000 through 2002 under section 301 demonstration
authority and guidance contained in previous appropriations
conference reports. Within the total provided, the remaining
$15,000,000 is to continue the initiative to assist States to
identify the characteristics of the uninsured within the State
and develop approaches for providing all uninsured persons with
health coverage. The conferees intend these funds to be
available to provide additional grants to States that have
previously received planning grants in order to assist such
States in continuing their data gathering, analysis and
planning processes, as well as to provide initial grants to
additional States as appropriate.
The conference agreement includes $156,562,000 for
program management instead of $149,294,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $143,354,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
expect HRSA to use no more than one percent of the funds
allocated for projects for agency administrative expenses.
The conferees are concerned that planned efforts to
restructure HRSA programs and grants management functions could
have a negative effect on many HRSA grantees. The
centralization of grant decision-making, coupled with the
changing roles of staff in HRSA's field offices, could
significantly diminish the institutional knowledge and
expertise in community-based health care that is crucial to
leading HRSA forward during this importantperiod. Further,
contemplated changes in the role of a project officer to reduce
technical assistance functions in favor of increased focus on grantee
performance reviews may serve to undermine the development and
functioning of HRSA funded programs and is of great concern to the
conferees. The conferees recommend that these changes not be undertaken
until they can work with all stakeholders, including Congress, to show
that they will not reduce the level and scope of assistance provided to
grantees.

CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
Disease Control, Research, and Training
The conference agreement includes $4,506,965,000 for
disease control, research, and training at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of which $4,296,566,000
is provided as budget authority and $210,399,000 is made
available under Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act,
instead of $4,402,249,000 as provided by the Senate. H.R. 246
included $4,335,839,000 for the CDC.
The conference agreement includes bill language to
earmark $268,000,000 for equipment, construction, and
renovation of facilities instead of $270,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate. H.R. 246 included $200,000,000. Within this total,
$250,000,000 is for continuation of CDC's building program for
its Atlanta facilities and $18,000,000 is to begin construction
and purchase equipment for the replacement of CDC's infectious
disease laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado. The
confereescontinue to support the rapid implementation of CDC's
Buildings and Facilities Master Plan and are pleased with the progress
made to date.
The conferees expect the CDC to utilize a portion of the
funds provided for buildings and facilities to continue and
expand security improvements to ensure critical information
reliability for response to critical events, as well as to
conduct increasingly varied public health missions.
The conference agreement includes bill language to allow
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to enter
into a single contract or related contracts for the full scope
of development and construction of facilities as proposed by
the Senate. H.R. 246 contained no similar provision. The
conference agreement also includes bill language proposed by
the Senate to allow funds appropriated to the CDC to be used to
enter into a long-term ground lease for construction on non-
Federal land, in order to replace their laboratory in the Fort
Collins, Colorado area. H.R. 246 included no similar language.
The conference agreement includes bill language to
earmark $183,763,000 for international HIV/AIDS, the same as
proposed by the Senate and H.R. 246. The conference agreement
deletes bill language proposed by the Senate earmarking
$40,000,000 of the amount provided for international HIV/AIDS
for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention
Initiative. The conferees are agreed, however, that $40,000,000
of the amount provided for international HIV/AIDS is for this
important initiative.
The conference agreement includes language in the bill
designating that the following amounts shall be available under
section 241 (Public Health Service Act evaluation set-aside)
for the specified activities:
$125,899,000--National Center for Health Statistics Surveys
$14,000,000--National Immunization Surveys
$28,600,000--Information Systems Standards Development and
Architecture and Applications-based Research Used
at Local Public Health Levels
$41,900,000--Research Tools and Approaches within the National
Occupational Research Agenda
H.R. 246 had proposed that $46,982,000 be derived from
section 241 for National Center for Health Statistics surveys.
The conference agreement modifies the placement of bill
language proposed by the Senate exempting from any personnel
ceiling applicable to the Agency, Service, or the Department of
Health and Human Services both civilians and Commissioned
Officers detailed to States, municipalities or other
organizations under authority of Section 214 of the Public
Health Service Act for purposes related to homeland security
during their period of detail or assignment. The agreement
places the bill language within the Public Health and Social
Services Emergency Fund account.
The conference agreement includes a modification to the
proviso carried in prior appropriations acts prohibiting the
use of funds available to the CDC to advocate or promote gun
control, as proposed in H.R. 246. The Senate bill included a
similar proviso. The conferees acknowledge that the purpose of
this proviso is to prohibit Federal funds from being used to
lobby for or against the passage of specific Federal, State or
local legislation intended to advocate or promote gun control.
The conferees understand that the CDC's responsibility in this
area is primarily data collection and the dissemination of
information and expect research in this area to be objective
and grants to be awarded through an impartial, scientific peer
review process. The conferees instruct the CDC to provide a
detailed report, within 90 days of enactment, on the steps the
CDC has taken to ensure this restriction is being followed.
The conference agreement includes a modification to a
proviso, proposed by the Senate, to raise the funding limit for
grants made under section 1509 of the Public Health Service Act
(WISEWOMAN screening demonstrations). The agreement increases
the limitation to $12,500,000, instead of $15,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 maintained the limit at
$10,000,000. The conferees are agreed that the increase in the
limitation is intended to permit, but not mandate, an increase
in the awards under this authority to $12,500,000 in fiscal
year 2003.
Birth Defects
The conference agreement includes $98,681,000 for birth
defects, developmental disabilities, disability and health
instead of $97,691,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246
included $94,655,000 for these activities.
Within the total, the following amounts are provided for
the specified activities above the fiscal year 2003 request:
$2,000,000--to expand State autism surveillance activities;
$2,000,000--to expand surveillance and epidemiological efforts
of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy;
$500,000--to activities related to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome;
$842,000--to expand the newborn infant screening program; and
$2,000,000--to support the establishment of a National Spina
Bifida program.
In addition, $3,800,000 is provided to continue and
expand support for the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes
Initiative begun last year.
The conferees encourage the CDC to continue its
partnership with the Amputee Coalition of America (ACA) and its
support of the Limb Loss Research and Statistics Program. The
Committee is also supportive of the partnership that the ACA
and CDC have forged with the uniformed services in an effort to
ensure that members of our armed forces receive the highest
quality of care in the event of an amputation.
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
The conference agreement includes $795,140,000 for
chronic disease prevention and health promotion instead of
$745,600,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 proposed
$773,928,000. Programs within this account are funded at the
following levels:
Heart Disease and Stroke................................  $ 43,244,000

Within the amounts provided for Cancer Prevention and
Control, no less than $200,383,000 is for the Breast and
Cervical Cancer Screening Program and $1,000,000 is for the
establishment of a national lupus patient registry. The
conferees urge the CDC to work closely with the Lupus
Foundation of America in the establishment of the registry.
Within the amounts available for Arthritis and Other
Chronic Diseases, the agreement provides an increase over the
request of $850,000 for the expansion of State-based arthritis
programs and collaborations with the relevant voluntary health
organizations. In addition, an increase of $1,000,000 over the
request is provided to enhance epilepsy efforts, in partnership
with a national non-profit organization that works on behalf of
children and adults affected by seizures.
Within amounts provided for Community Health Promotion,
$6,903,000 is provided to support and expand the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance Systems, $2,800,000 for continuing and
expanding a model project that is testing and evaluating the
efficacy of glaucoma screening using mobile units, $1,900,000
is for a vision screening and education program as outlined in
the Senate explanatory statement, and $1,800,000 is for the
Mind-Body Medical Institute in Boston, Massachusetts to
continue and expand practice-based assessments, identification,
and study of promising and heavily-used mind/body practices.
The conferees encourage CDC to expand its public and
professional awareness activities with respect to pulmonary
hypertension and to report to the Committees on Appropriations
within six months on the progress made in advancing this
important initiative.
The conferees understand that the Iron Disorders
Institute provides important educational material to the public
and the medical community and encourages the CDC to establish a
partnership with the Institute.
Environmental Health
The conference agreement includes $184,025,000 for
environmental health instead of $189,489,000 as proposed by the
Senate. H.R. 246 included $174,917,000 for environmental health
activities.
Within the total provided: $37,763,000 is for the
environmental health laboratory; $38,863,000 is for
environmental health activities (including $2,200,000 to
continue the physician education and public awareness program
for primary immune deficiency disease as implemented by the
Jeffrey Modell Foundation); $37,127,000 is for asthma;
$42,272,000 is for childhood lead poisoning; and $28,000,000 is
for the health-tracking network.
The conferees recognize the extraordinary services of
CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory, and have provided funds
to expand the assessment of exposure of the U.S. population to
environmental chemicals, to expand assistance to States, and
provide more effective laboratory response to toxic
emergencies.
The conferees are concerned about the health status of
the residents of rural communities. The conferees understand
that the CDC currently is developing a rural health plan to
address the variety of rural public health issues related to
environmental exposures. The conferees urge the CDC to continue
to work closely with the State of Iowa Public Health Department
in developing this plan.
Epidemic Services
The conference agreement includes $78,001,000 for
epidemic services and response as proposed by the Senate. H.R.
246 included the same amount for epidemic services.
HIV/AIDS, STD and TB Prevention
The conference agreement includes $1,194,150,000 for HIV/
AIDS, STD and TB prevention instead of $1,183,532,000 as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included $1,175,000,000 for
these activities.
Included in this amount is $887,961,000 for HIV/AIDS
activities, of which $183,763,000 is for global HIV/AIDS
activities; $169,675,000 for STD activities; and $136,514,000
for TB activities. Within the funds provided for global HIV/
AIDS, $40,000,000 is for the International Mother and Child HIV
Prevention Initiative.
Within the total for HIV/AIDS, $104,000,000 is provided
to continue CDC's support of activities that are targeted to
address the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and its disparate impact
on communities of color, including African Americans, Latinos,
Native Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Pacific Islanders at not less than the fiscal year 2002 level.
The conferees expect CDC to follow the report accompanying the
Labor, HHS and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act, 2002 regarding the disbursement of these funds, including
continuing support for the Directly Funded Minority Community
Based Organization Program.
Immunization
The conference agreement includes a discretionary program
level total of $654,751,000 for immunization, instead of
$652,895,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included
$634,601,000 for immunization activities. Within the total,
$14,000,000 is for national immunization surveys to be derived
from section 241 evaluation set-aside funds. In addition, the
Vaccines for Children (VFC) program funded through the Medicaid
program is expected to provide $1,056,000,000 in vaccine
purchases and distribution support in fiscal year 2003, for a
total immunization program level of $1,699,751,000.
Included in the amount provided is $505,963,000 for the
section 317 program, and $148,788,000 for global immunization
activities. Within the total available for global immunization,
$106,400,000 is for global polio eradication activities, and
$42,388,000 for the global measles program.
It has been brought to the conferees' attention that
infrastructure costs of delivering vaccines to children in
Alaska are substantially higher than in other areas of the
country because of the many small, remote communities that must
be served primarily by air. The conferees encourage CDC to
increase section 317 grant support for infrastructure
development and purchase of vaccines for the State of Alaska's
universal immunization program.
Infectious Diseases
The conference agreement includes $345,471,000 for
infectious diseases instead of $334,471,000 as proposed by the
Senate. H.R. 246 included $353,961,000 for infectious diseases.
Within the total provided, $1,000,000 above the budget
request is for a prevention program to control and reduce the
incidence of hepatitis C. This funding is to continue to
develop State-based programs and demonstrations to learn the
most feasible approach to integrating hepatitis C and B
screening, counseling, and referral programs into existing HIV
and STD State programs.
Within the total provided, $8,000,000 above the request
is to augment CDC's resources for supporting States in
developing and implementing effective surveillance, prevention,
and control of West Nile virus and support research on the
biology of the disease.
Within the total provided, $2,000,000 above the request
is to expand and improve surveillance, research, and prevention
activities on prion disease. The conferees intend that a
significant portion of the increase be used to expand support
for the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center to
establish a national autopsy network for prion disease
surveillance.
The conferees are pleased that the CDC is restoring funds
for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome research and that these funds are
being used in substantive areas. The conferees encourage CDC to
continue the establishment of a national registry.

control, as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 provided
$148,464,000 for injury control.
Within the total provided, $3,000,000 is provided to
extend implementation of the National Violent Death Reporting
System. In addition, sufficient funds are included to continue
support for all existing Injury Control Research Centers. The
conferees also intend that $1,000,000 of the funds provided
above the request augment funding for the Traumatic Brain
Injury prevention program.
Occupational Safety and Health
The conference agreement provides a program level of
$274,899,000 for occupational safety and health, the same as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included $275,161,000 for
occupational safety and health. Included within the available
funds is $41,900,000 to carry out research tools and approaches
activities within the National Occupational Research Agenda

significant adverse neurological impact on the health of those
workers.
The conferees support NIOSH's efforts in domestic
terrorism preparedness, including work to protect emergency
responders from biological and chemical terrorism exposures, as
well as industrial accidents. The conferees urge NIOSH to fast-
track its work to recognize the military affiliated laboratory
expertise and certification and to certify military equipment
for appropriate civilian use, particularly where any needed
modifications are simple.
The conferees support continuation of the joint
interagency initiative which involves the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health, the Federal Aviation
Administration, and the National Transportation SafetyBoard.
The conferees encourage NIOSH to continue to implement the Board's
recommendations to improve aviation safety in Alaska.
Public Health Improvement

of $153,848,000 for public health improvement instead of
$115,672,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included

NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
National Cancer Institute
The conference agreement includes $4,622,394,000 for the
National Cancer Institute instead of $4,642,394,000 as proposed
by the Senate and $4,299,493,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees note with concern the Lung Cancer Progress
Review Group's August 2001 report, which concluded that the
nation's health care system is poorly organized to deal with
lung cancer and that a pervasive sense of ``therapeutic
nihilism'' dominates the public and scientific discussion of
this disease. The conferees urge NCI to consider implementing
the group's recommendations, particularly regarding the
creation of multi-institutional, multidisciplinary lung cancer
consortia. The conferees request the NCI to submit a report on
the group's recommendations by June 30, 2003.
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute
The conference agreement includes $2,812,011,000 for the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute instead of
$2,820,011,000 as proposed by the Senate and $2,698,391,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees encourage NHLBI, in collaboration with the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to
enhance its efforts to develop a diagnostic test for
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) that would be
suitable for screening the blood supply. Currently, there is no
suitable method for identifying TSE-infected blood or humans
infected with TSEs. Human TSEs, for which there are no known
treatments, include Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The conferees are aware of the impact of cystic fibrosis
on children and adults and commend the voluntary associations
that focus on combating this life-threatening genetic disease.
The conferees urge the NIH to work with these organizations and
outside researchers in supporting research related to the
diagnosis and treatment of patients who are affected by this
disease.
The conferees are interested in efforts to find a cure
for Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a progressive and often
fatal lung disease of young women with no effective treatment.
Accordingly, the conferees urge the NHLBI to explore
opportunities for funding clinical treatment trials through
both intramural and extramural means and to use all available
mechanisms, as appropriate, including supporting state-of-the-
science symposia and facilitating access to human tissues, to
stimulate a broad range of clinical and basic LAM research.
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
The conference agreement includes $374,067,000 for the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research as
proposed by the Senate instead of $360,528,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
The conference agreement includes $1,633,347,000 for the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases instead of $1,637,347,000 as proposed by the Senate
and $1,532,394,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees are concerned about the alarming growth in
kidney disease and end stage renal disease and anticipated
shortages of the professionals in nephrology that will be
needed to handle these cases. NIDDK is encouraged to consider
launching new training initiatives and workshops such as grant
writing seminars to foster increased interest in this
subspecialty.
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
The conference agreement includes $1,466,005,000 for the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as
proposed by the Senate instead of $1,372,256,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
The conferees encourage NINDS, in collaboration with
NIAID, to expand support for controlled clinical trials to
better understand the effect of neutralizing antibodies on
current therapies on multiple sclerosis, and to produce better
clinical data on effective combination therapies using existing
therapies that have been approved for MS and other conditions.
The conferees further encourage NINDS to conduct a scientific
workshop on the role of neutralizing antibodies in MS therapy
and new approaches for treatment of MS with combination
therapies of drugs approved for MS and other conditions.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
The conference agreement includes $3,730,973,000 for the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases instead
of $3,727,473,000 as proposed by the Senate and $2,674,213,000
as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes bill language
permitting the transfer of $100,000,000 to International
Assistance Programs, Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria,
and Tuberculosis as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included a
general provision permitting the Director of NIH to transfer
this amount to the Global Fund from funds appropriated to NIH.
The conference agreement includes bill language
allocating up to $375,000,000 for extramural facilities
construction grants for research on biological and other
agents. The Senate had proposed $150,000,000 for these grants.
H.R. 246 had no similar provision. The conferees intend to
provide NIAID with flexibility to determine the appropriate
share of the Institute's funds directed to bioterrorism
research versus infrastructure.
National Institute of General Medical Sciences
The conference agreement includes $1,859,084,000 for the
National Institute of General Medical Sciences instead of
$1,853,584,000 as proposed by the Senate and $1,742,596,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
The conference agreement includes $1,213,817,000 for the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as
proposed by the Senate instead of $1,159,405,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
The conferees recognize that the therapeutic potentials
of adult and embryonic stem cells need to be studied in animal
models. The conferees remain concerned about the absence of
research dedicated to investigating stem cells in the most
clinically relevant models. To maintain a position of
scientific leadership in embryonic stem cell research, the
conferees urge NICHD to support research using approved stem
cell lines that investigate adult and embryonic stem cells in
vitro and in nonhuman primates.
Congenital limb deficiency, vascular disease, childhood
skeletal malignancy and trauma have resulted in over 1,500,000
persons in the U.S. experiencing limb loss. Technological
advancements today offerconsiderable opportunity for persons
with limb loss to effectively resume active, productive lives.
Standards of care for persons with limb loss have not been developed,
however, nor have clinical outcomes research been conducted to
determine appropriate access to advanced technology prosthetic devices
and the importance of related physical rehabilitation and therapy to
improve performance among persons who utilize prosthetic devices. The
conferees encourage the Institute to support a prosthetic outcomes
research consensus conference, with an emphasis on consumer input, to
develop a research protocol to comprehensively address these concerns.
National Eye Institute
The conference agreement includes $637,290,000 for the
National Eye Institute instead of $634,290,000 as proposed by
the Senate and $600,796,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
Ocular albinism (OA) is a hereditary, blinding disease
that causes terribly distorted vision in children. Victims, who
are usually boys and receive the defective gene from their
mothers, experience nystagmus, photophobia, lack of
stereoscopic vision, strabismus, and other symptoms which deny
these children normal vision. In recent years, great strides
have been made in the search for improved diagnostic tools and
treatments. Recently, the OA1 gene, responsible for most cases
of the disease, was identified, and a diagnostic screening test
created to help women determine if they are at risk of passing
the disease on to their children. As researchers move closer to
understanding how this disease works, and developing potential
treatments that could improve the vision of children with the
condition, the conferees direct NEI to be prepared to report on
advances in research on ocular albinism.
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
The conference agreement includes $618,258,000 for the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences instead of
$617,258,000 as proposed by the Senate and $589,701,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees commend NIEHS for its recent efforts to
bolster research initiatives on the environmental influences of
breast cancer. The conferees recognize the serious lack of
research on the relationship between the environment and breast
cancer, and believe that it is important for the Institute to
support such research. The conferees urge the Institute to
establish a group of breast cancer and environmental research
advisers to make recommendations to the Director with regard to
the support of the breast cancer and environmental research,
and to include in the group representatives from the breast
cancer community who have had breast cancer. The conferees
request an update at the fiscal year 2004 hearings on the
progress in establishing an advisory group. The conferees
encourage NIEHS to consider establishing centers to conduct
multi-disciplinary and multi-institution research on
environmental factors that may be related to breast cancer.
National Institute on Aging
The conference agreement includes $1,000,099,000 for the
National Institute on Aging as proposed by the Senate instead
of $939,608,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases
The conference agreement includes $489,324,000 for the
National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases as proposed by the Senate instead of $474,392,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
Vitiligo is an environmental and genetic auto-immune
disease of unknown origin which affects about three to six
million Americans. Almost 50 percent develop the disease in
childhood, with the median age of onset at four years of age.
In its most severe forms, patients have milky white patches
covering widespread areas of the body due to the loss of
pigment in these areas. Especially for young children, the
physical pain caused by severe burns from the harmful effects
of sunlight and the emotional pain caused by people confusing
vitiligo with an infectious disease diminishes the quality of a
patient's life. There are no FDA-approved treatments for
children. The conferees urge NIAMS to enhance research efforts
through all available mechanisms, as appropriate, to identify
the causes of this disease and develop pediatric treatment
options for vitiligo.
National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
The conference agreement includes $372,805,000 for the
National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders as proposed by the Senate instead of $351,376,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute of Nursing Research
The conference agreement includes $131,438,000 for the
National Institute of Nursing Research as proposed by the
Senate instead of $130,044,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
The conference agreement includes $418,773,000 for the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as proposed
by the Senate instead of $401,933,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute on Drug Abuse
The conference agreement includes $968,013,000 for the
National Institute on Drug Abuse as proposed by the Senate
instead of $912,489,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conferees commend NIDA for its partnership with the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, particularly the
ongoing support NIDA provides to the sites established by the
Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC). The conferees
encourage the continuation and expansion of NIDA funding for
these research centers where CTAC has likewise committed
resources.
National Institute of Mental Health
The conference agreement includes $1,349,788,000 for the
National Institute of Mental Health instead of $1,350,788,000
as proposed by the Senate and $1,290,274,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
The conferees are concerned that the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks have taken a toll on mental health in
America, and urge the Institute to conduct studies on the
effects of such events and disasters so that best practices can
be developed. Research should focus on survivors, emergency
workers and the general public to understand the degree of
mental trauma suffered and to understand how post traumatic
stress affects these different populations.
National Human Genome Research Institute
The conference agreement includes $468,037,000 for the
National Human Genome Research Institute as proposed by the
Senate instead of $431,985,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering
The conference agreement includes $280,100,000 for the
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering
instead of $283,100,000 as proposed by the Senate and
$140,973,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Center for Research Resources
The conference agreement includes $1,146,272,000 for the
National Center for Research Resources instead of
$1,161,272,000 as proposed by the Senate and $1,015,395,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes bill language to
earmark $120,000,000 for extramural facilities construction
grants instead of $97,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and
$125,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Within the total provided for NCRR, $210,000,000 is for
the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) program and
$312,000,000 is for the General Clinical Research Centers. Of
the IDeA grants funding, $127,000,000 is designated for the
Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence program and
$83,000,000 is designated for the Biomedical Research
Infrastructure Networks program.
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
The conference agreement includes $114,149,000 for the
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as
proposed by the Senate instead of $105,212,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes sufficient funds to
increase support for the chiropractic research center.
National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities
The conference agreement includes $186,929,000 for the
National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities as
proposed by the Senate instead of $151,062,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
John E. Fogarty International Center
The conference agreement includes $63,880,000 for the
John E. Fogarty International Center instead of $60,880,000 as
proposed by the Senate and $57,064,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
National Library of Medicine
The conference agreement includes $310,299,000 for the
National Library of Medicine, of which $8,200,000 is made
available through the evaluation set-aside, as proposed by the
Senate instead of $277,273,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. Bill
language is included, as proposed by the Senate, to make
available $8,200,000 from amounts available under section 241
of the Public Health Service Act to carry out the National
Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care
Technology. H.R. 246 did not contain a similar provision.
Office of the Director
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement includes $267,974,000 for the
Office of the Director instead of $257,974,000 as proposed by
the Senate and $2,476,111,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement provides $20,000,000 for the
Director's Discretionary Fund rather than $10,000,000 as
provided by H.R. 246 and the Senate in order that the Director
of NIH may allocate resources to the Institutes and Centers to
begin ``roadmap'' activities.
The conferees concur with the guidance in the Senate
explanatory statement regarding limits for NIH reprogramming
requests.
The conference agreement reflects the funding and grant
transfers that will be made to the National Institute of
Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering from other institutes and
centers.
The conferees concur with the Senate explanatory
statement encouraging NIH to increase the research training
stipend awards by ten percent.
The conferees are agreed that NIH should continue to
allocate funds for biomedical research on the basis of
scientific opportunity, taking into consideration the many
other factors identified by NIH as being relevant to funding
decisions, such as the infectious nature of a disease, the
number of cases and deaths associated with a disease, the cost
of disease treatment, and/or other costs associated with a
disease. The conferees also expect NIH to consider carefully
the language in appropriations explanatory statements and give
it appropriate weight when determining funding allocations
across disease areas. Regarding the cases in which
appropriations explanatory statements reference funding levels
for a specific disease, the conferees are agreed that these are
intended only to express relative priority and are not funding
earmarks.
The conferees do not agree to the budget request to use
NIH funding to support Department of Defense free electron
laser research and radiation exposure research.
The conferees have previously provided funding for the
design of a new facility for the National Library of Medicine
and understand that the design phase of this project is nearly
complete. The conferees request the Director of NIH to provide
a report by June 30, 2003 to the Committees on Appropriations
with details of the new facility, timetables and costs, based
on a construction plan consistent with recommendations from the
NIH Facilities Planning Advisory Committee.
The conferees request that the NIH Interagency Autism
Coordinating Committee (IACC) convene a panel of outstanding
scientists to assess the field of autism research, and identify
the roadblocks that may be hindering progress in understanding
its causes and best treatment options. As a next step, the IACC
should take the recommendations of these findings and develop a
matrix of short-to-long range and low-to-high risk action items
to address some of the roadblocks identified by the panel. This
matrix would then be used to help guide further autism research
planning at NIH, and as a tool for the entire autism community.
It should include opportunities for voluntary and private
funding organizations, and hopefully will lead to opportunities
for collaboration with other government agencies and the autism
community as well. The matrix should be a living document that
can be revised and expanded as current goals are achieved and
new goals are identified. Once the matrix has been developed,
the IACC should provide a report to Congress on the state of
autism research.
Pick's disease is a rare form of frontotemporal dementia
that leads to a degeneration of social skills, language,
reasoning abilities, and memory. Although the cause of this
disease is unknown, researchers now appreciate the degree to
which disorders such as Pick's disease are related to other
frontotemporal dementias, and even more common forms of
dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. Alterations of the tau
protein, which is an important structural component of neurons,
have been implicated in all of these disorders, and provide an
important common target for further exploration. NIA and NINDS
are encouraged to support research on frontotemporal dementias,
including Pick's disease, as well as related tauopathies, that
may reveal insights into the causes and possible treatments of
these conditions.
Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder seen almost
exclusively in females; it affects approximately one in ten
thousand live births per year. The conferees are pleased to
learn of the discovery of the MECP2 gene as the main cause of
this disorder and encourage the Institutes to expand their
research efforts to learn how this gene affects other genes and
tissues during the development of the nervous system. The
conferees also encourage research to develop animal models of
the disorder and to study the daily problems that afflict
children with Rett syndrome, including autonomic disorders, as
well as research on interventions for improved literacy and
communication. Because Rett syndrome is a multi-faceted
disorder, the conferees encourage NICHD, NINDS, NIDCD, and
NIGMS to work in collaboration to maximize the outcomes from
investments made in Rett syndrome research.
The Department has conducted a comprehensive review of
research on products containing the herb ephedra, and the
conferees look forward to seeing this work in the near future.
The conferees recommend that, following publication of this
work and a thorough dialogue between the Department, industry
and others, NIH initiate scientific studies necessary to
resolve any remaining questions on the safety and benefits of
these products.
The conferees request NIH to provide a report by June 30,
2003 summarizing, by grant and amount, actual fiscal year 2002
research funding on temporomandibular diseases and disorders,
as well as an estimate of fiscal year 2003 expenditures.
Buildings and Facilities
The conference agreement includes $632,800,000 for
buildings and facilities instead of $607,800,000 as proposed by
the Senate and $296,100,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes language granting full
scope authority for the contracting of construction of the
first and second phases of the John E. Porter Neurosciences
Building as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 did not have a
similar provision.
The conference agreement includes $105,000,000 for the
NIH research building proposed in the budget request to be
constructed on Department of Army land at Ft. Detrick,
Maryland.
The conferees were saddened by the recent passing of
Florence S. Mahoney, one of the nation's foremost advocates for
health research and a pioneer in the development of the NIH.
Beginning in the 1940s, Mahoney teamed up with another citizen
activist, Mary Lasker, to seek a greater Federal investment in
health sciences and biomedical research. They were
extraordinarily effective. Mrs. Mahoney's crowning achievement
was her almost singlehanded campaign to create the National
Institute on Aging. That event, in 1974, opened the way to
scientific advances aimed at extending the healthy years of
life and maintaining functional independence for millions of
older Americans. She embodied that ideal, living independently
until her death at age 103. Mahoney was the last of a
generation of giants--including Lasker, James Shannon, Senator
Lister Hill and Representative John Fogarty--who built the
modern NIH. The conferees strongly urge the NIH to honor her
memory by designating one of two outdoor courtyards in the Mark
O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, now under construction,
as the ``Florence S. Mahoney Plaza (or Courtyard).'' The
conferees hope that such a space will include a stone marker,
plaque or sculpture that would prominently pay tribute to
Mahoney's enormous contributions to the NIH.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
The conference agreement includes $3,232,268,000 for
substance abuse and mental health services, of which
$3,158,068,000 is provided through budget authority and
$74,200,000 is provided through the evaluation set-aside. H.R.
246 had proposed $3,167,897,000 for SAMHSA and the Senate
proposed $3,203,917,000, of which $74,200,000 was from the
evaluation set-aside.
The conference agreement contains bill language providing
$955,000 for protection, maintenance and remediation of
Federally-owned facilities at St. Elizabeths Hospital as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 had no similar provision.
The conference agreement includes bill language
identifying $21,461,000 for projects in the amounts specified
in the statement of the managers on the conference report.
Center for Mental Health Services
The conference agreement includes $246,042,000 for
programs of regional and national significance instead of
$226,067,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate.
Within the total provided, the conference agreement
provides $95,000,000 for counseling services for school-aged
youth as proposed by the Senate. As proposed by the Senate,
$3,000,000 is provided to support the National Suicide
Prevention Resource Center, and continued support is provided
for the Suicide Prevention Hotline program.
Within the total provided, $30,000,000 is provided under
section 582 of the Public Health Service Act to support grants
to local mental health providers for the purposes of developing
knowledge of best practices and providing mental health
services to children and youth suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder as a result of having witnessed or experienced
a traumatic event. These funds are provided through the SAMHSA
appropriation rather than $10,000,000 being provided through
the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 above the
request to continue the current level of funding for the
consumer and consumer-supported national technical assistance
centers as proposed by the Senate. The conferees direct CMHS to
support multi-year grants to five such national technical
assistance centers.
The conference agreement provides $5,000,000 to continue
the elderly treatment and outreach program as proposed by the
Senate.
As proposed by the Senate, the conference agreement
provides $5,000,000 for the jail diversion program and
$1,000,000 for new awards under the community action grant
program.
The conferees include the following amounts for the
following projects and activities in fiscal year 2003:
Access Community Health Network in Chicago, Illinois for
an initiative to improve mental health services at
their community health centers......................    $350,000
Arab-American & Chaldean Council, Lathrup Village,

abuse and HIV/AIDS.
Within the total funding for the Minority HIV/AIDS
Initiative, $40,100,000 is to provide grants for planning and
services to organizations with a history of providing services
to high risk communities of color to enhance the quality of
services and to expand substance abuse prevention service
capacity in communities of color disproportionately impacted by
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Program Management
The conference agreement includes $86,467,000 for program
management, of which $12,000,000 is provided through the
evaluation set-aside. This is the same allocation as proposed
by the Senate. H.R. 246 proposed $91,467,000.
AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY
Healthcare Research and Quality
The conference agreement includes $303,695,000 instead of
$298,745,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $308,645,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The agreement provides all these funds
through the policy evaluation set-aside. H.R. 246 had provided
$296,145,000 through the evaluation set-aside. The Senate had
provided these funds through budget authority. The conference
agreement also provides $5,000,000 for AHRQ bioterrorism
activities through the Public Health and Social Services
Emergency Fund.
The agreement provides $55,000,000 for reducing medical
errors as proposed by H.R. 246. The Senate provided

insurance and expenditure surveys as proposed by the Senate

provides $2,700,000 for program management as proposed by the
Senate instead of $2,600,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement does not permit the transfer of
$10,000,000 to the Department of Commerce for the Current
Population Survey. This is consistent with H.R. 246 and the
Senate bill.
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES
Program Management
The conference agreement includes $2,581,672,000 for
program management instead of $2,550,488,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $2,559,664,000 as proposed by the Senate. An
additional appropriation of $720,000,000 has been provided for
the Medicare Integrity Program through the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as proposed by the
Senate rather than $700,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. A
citation for the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits
Improvement and Protection Act proposed by H.R. 246 is not
included in the conference agreement because more general
authorities are cited.
Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation
The conference agreement includes $74,194,000 for
research, demonstration, and evaluation instead of $68,400,000
as proposed by the Senate and $33,510,000 as proposed by H.R.
246.
Within the total provided, $40,000,000 is for Real Choice
Systems Change Grants to States. The conferees continue to
strongly support the Real Choice Systems Change grants and
expect CMS to provide expanded technical assistance to the
consumer task forces involved with the program by contracting
with a consortium of consumer controlled organizations for
people with disabilities. The conferees request the Secretary
to report on the activities and accomplishments of the
Community Living Exchange Cooperative by July 1, 2003.
The conferees are pleased with the currently ongoing
Prescription Continuity of Care and Emergency Department
Continuity of Care Projects and recommend their continuation.
The conferees are pleased with the demonstration project being

Medicare Contractors
The conference agreement includes $1,677,584,000 for
Medicare contractors instead of $1,675,084,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $1,680,084,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within
the total provided, $12,500,000 is to support grants for State
Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance programs as proposed
by the Senate. The conferees recommend that CMS eliminate the
five percent cap on transferring funds between functions so
that contractors may have greater flexibility to manage their
resources to match programmatic needs.
Federal Administration
The conference agreement includes $575,497,000 for
Federal administration rather than $587,497,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $556,783,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
agreement provides $13,000,000 for the Medicaid Healthy Start,
Grow Smart campaign.
The conferees direct that the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services utilize data reflecting the current cost of
liability insurance to determine current Medicare payment
rates, including annual updates to the malpractice geographic
practice cost index.
The conferees are concerned about the widespread failure
of States to provide screening for lead poisoning to children
served by Medicaid, as required by Federal law. The conferees
expect CMS to provide national leadership to ensure Medicaid
lead screening consistent with age and risk factors recommended
by CDC. CMS is also encouraged to ensure Medicaid coverage of
environmental investigations, including analysis of samples to
identify lead hazards in the home of a poisoned child.
The conferees direct the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to review the Medicare Geographic Classification
Review Board's criteria for reclassification determinations
with respect to making payments to hospitals. The conferees
request the review to include a detailed analysis of
disparities among hospitals' reimbursement rates for hospitals
in metropolitan statistical areas that border on areas that
have higher wage indices; the difficulty hospitals face in
losing skilled medical personnel to neighboring areas with
urban classifications and higher wage and salary structures;
geographic and environmental impediments to traditional
community routes; the base costs on which the wage index is
applied; and the effect lower wage indices have on the quality
of care. The conferees expect the Secretary to report to the
Committees no later than May 30, 2003.
The conferees concur in the language in the Senate
explanatory statement requesting the Secretary to conduct a
comprehensive study of current literature and best practices to
determine the cost-effectiveness of behavioral-based weight
loss services. The conferees expect such a study to be
completed within six months of enactment of the appropriations
bill.
The conferees are agreed that the last paragraph under
CMS Program Management, Federal administration, in the Senate
explanatory statement, pertaining to a study of claims data, is
deleted.
The conferees urge CMS to promulgate regulations
establishing the same definition of ``audiologist'' for the
Medicaid program as is currently used in the Medicare program.
The conferees also note that both the Department of Veterans
Affairs and the Office of Personnel Management allow
participants in their respective health care programs direct
access to audiologists, and recommend that CMS adopt a policy
for Medicare consistent with these successful initiatives.
The conferees are concerned about the growing national
shortage of nursing and allied health professionals. This
concern is evidenced by the recent passage of the Nurse
Reinvestment Act of 2002. Medicare has historically paid a
share of the net costs of approved nursing and allied health
education costs associated with a nursing and allied health
education program operated by a hospital. The conferees are
particularly concerned about nursing and allied health
educational programs that cannot meet the regulations set forth
at 42 C.F.R. Sec. 413.85(f) solely as a result of regional
educational accrediting criteria. Given the shortage of nursing
and allied health professionals, the conferees support the
payment of costs on a reasonable cost basis for a hospital that
has historically been the operator of nursing and allied health
educational program(s) that qualified for Medicare payments
under 42 C.F.R. Sec. 413.85, but, solely in order to meet
educational standards, subsequently relinquishes some control
over the program(s) to an educational institution, which: meets
regional accrediting standards; is wholly owned by the
provider; and is supported by the hospital, i.e., the hospital
is incurring the costs of both the classroom and clinical
training portions of the program. Moreover, a hospital could
bear all the costs of the training but share curriculum control
with the educational institution. It was not the intent of
Congress in Section 6205 of Public Law 101-239 nor Section
4159(b) of Public Law 101-508 to preclude hospitals from
receiving reasonable cost pass-through payments for nursing and
allied health educational programs based solely on conflicting
accreditation educational standards.
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
Refugee and Entrant Assistance
The conference agreement appropriates $446,724,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 instead of $442,724, 000 as proposed by
the Senate. Within this amount, $151,121,000 is provided for
Social Services, as proposed in H.R. 246. The Senate bill
included $147,121,000 for this purpose.
The conferees recognize the importance of continued
educational support to schools with a significant proportion of
refugee children, consistent with previous support to schools
heavily impacted by large concentrations of refugees, and urge
the Office of Refugee Resettlement to support these efforts
should funding become available in the Social Services or other
accounts.
The agreement also includes $19,000,000 for increased
support to communities with large concentrations of refugees
whose cultural differences make assimilation especially
difficult justifying a more intense level and longer duration
of Federal assistance.
Children and Families Services Programs
The conference agreement includes $8,643,117,000 for
children and families services programs instead of
$8,467,062,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $8,648,884,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Runaway youth
The conference agreement includes $90,567,000 for runaway

resources to meet the needs of more young people in need of
services.

abuse discretionary programs instead of $26,351,000 as proposed

services and income maintenance research instead of $6,000,000
as proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate. $6,000,000 of this
total is provided through the Public Health Service evaluation
funding tap as proposed by the Senate. The conferees note that
efforts undertaken through the State information technology
consortium have led to greatly improved systems communications
and compliance in both the TANF and child support enforcement

believe that the activities funded by the Community Services
Block Grant program have made an important difference in the
lives of many of our citizens living in some of the more
economically depressed parts of our country. However, it has
come to the attention of the conferees that one or more States
may have accumulated sizeable unexpended balances of CSBG funds
and have failed to reallocate all such funds to other eligible
grantees, as authorized by the Community Services Block Grant
Act. The conferees request that the Secretary of Health and
Human Services provide to the Committees on Appropriations a
report detailing the levels of unexpended balances of Community
Services Block Grant funds in each State for the period of

medication and adverse drug reactions among the elderly.

ombudsman/elder abuse prevention activities, instead of
$17,681,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $19,681,000 as proposed
by the Senate. The conferees intend that the $1,000,000
increase over last year's level should be made available for
the Long-Term Ombudsman Program. That will allow the program to
hire additional staff, expand public information and education
campaigns and upgrade technology.
The agreement also includes $6,250,000 for Native
American caregivers instead of $6,000,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $6,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $387,108,000 for
congregate meals; $182,169,000 for home delivered meals; and
$149,000,000 for the nutrition services incentives program. The
conference agreement amends the Older Americans Act and
transfers the Nutrition Services Incentives Program from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Administration on Aging
within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and
maintains access to commodities within USDA.

family life program as proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate. The

which $10,157,000 shall be for prevention grants under section

application of the limitation of section 2010(c) of Title XX of
the Public Health Service Act.
The agreement provides $56,592,000 for minority health
instead of $46,329,000 as proposed by the Senate and

under the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative have distributed this

organizations receiving MHAI funded grants and sub grants,
demonstrate how the participation of minority community-based
organizations has been maximized, and the extent to which the
funded agencies'/organizations' board, management and key staff

closest to the targeted problem, have a history of providing
services to these communities, and have documented linkages to
the targeted populations.
The conferees continue to recognize the importance of
OMH's partnerships with minority health professions
institutions. Specifically, the conferees encourage OMH to

The conferees are concerned about the adequacy of the
supply and production capacity for the anthrax vaccine
currently available in the U.S. to protect civilian populations
from the demonstrated threat of anthrax. The Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services is encouraged to
consult with other appropriate Federal and State agencies and
non-governmental organizations representing workers with a
higher risk of exposure to anthrax and provide an assessment of
the immediate potential combined national biodefense and short-
term preparedness need for anthrax vaccine. The assessment
should encompass the need for: immunizing civilian laboratory
workers, first responders and other at risk populations of
exposure to anthrax; providing sufficient vaccine stockpiles
for assuring public health preparedness to respond to anthrax
attacks; and providing additional production capacity as a
safeguard against an event which could result in a halt in
current vaccine production. The Secretary is further requested
to submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees within 60 days after enactment of this bill, which
includes the assessment of the combined potential need and
options for assuring both a multiple-year vaccine supply and
expansion of licensed vaccine production.
The conferees encourage the Secretary to establish a
Federal Working Group on Lupus to be comprised of
representatives from all relevant HHS agencies and other
Federal departments having an interest in lupus. The Working
Group should meet periodically for the purpose of exchanging
information and coordinating Federal efforts regarding lupus
research and education initiatives.
The conferees are concerned about the lack of mechanisms
to insure and deliver psychosocial care to patients with
cancer. Reports by the Institute of Medicine show that
appropriate psychosocial care is an important contributor to
quality of cancer care, but such care is not routinely
available or consistently reimbursed. The conferees urge the
Secretary, through relevant agencies such as NIMH, SAMHSA and
AHRQ, to study the delivery of psychosocial services to cancer
patients and report on the services available, who has access
to them, who uses them, how they are reimbursed, and the
effectiveness of specific interventions.
The conferees encourage the Secretary in conjunction with
the CDC and the relevant NIH institutes to assess the benefits
of a system providing nationwide access for physicians to a
multi-media Internet site with webcast and media response
capability. This type of system would allow the nation's
primary care providers to receive Federal news and alerts.
The conferees request a report from the Department
regarding its implementation of the revised guidance from the
Department of Justice on limited English proficiency. This
report should address the purpose and objectives of this
policy, as well as any funding for services provided to
implement the guidance, including publications, web site
construction costs, and language line contracts.
Office of Inspector General
The conference agreement includes $37,300,000 for the
Office of Inspector General as proposed by H.R. 246 instead of
$39,747,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Retirement Pay and Medical Benefits for Commissioned Officers
The conference agreement includes language proposed by
the Senate directing that health care benefits of retired
Commissioned Corps officers be paid from this account rather
than the accounts from the Public Health Service to which they
were assigned. H.R. 246 did not include a similar provision.
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund
The conference agreement includes $2,246,680,000 for the
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to
enhance Federal, State, and local preparedness to counter
potential biological, disease, chemical, and radiological
threats to civilian populations, instead of $2,255,980,000 as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 included $2,507,184,000 for
the PHSSEF.
The agreement also includes bill language included in
H.R. 246 to allow the Secretary to transfer amounts specified
in the account between categories subject to normal
reprogramming procedures. The Senate bill contained no similar
provision.
The conference agreement modifies the placement of bill
language proposed by the Senate exempting from any personnel
ceiling applicable to the Agency, Service, or the Department of
Health and Human Services both civilians and Commissioned
Officers detailed to States, municipalities or other
organizations under authority of Section 214 of the Public
Health Service Act for purposes related to homeland security
during their period detail or assignment. The agreement places
the bill language within this account, instead of within the
account for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as
proposed by the Senate.
Within the amount provided: $1,543,440,000 is for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; $546,000,000 is for
the Health Resources and Services Administration; $152,240,000

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
The conferees note that funds requested within this
account for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, Poison Control, and Emergency Medical Services
for Children have been provided within the accounts of their
respective agencies. This brings the comparable total for the
Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to
$2,298,680,000.
Within the amounts available to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC): $940,000,000 is for State and
Local Preparedness, $143,700,000 is for Upgrading CDC Capacity;

research program on anthrax vaccine; $10,700,000 is for
Planning for Preparedness Response; $4,000,000 is for
Deterrence; and $2,000,000 is to continue to discover, develop,
and transition anti-infective agents to combat emerging
diseases. The conference agreement also includes an increase of
$5,000,000 for Public Health Preparedness Centers as proposed
by the Senate.
The conferees understand that any countermeasures
recommended by the Federal government pursuant to the Homeland
Security Act (including, but not limited to vaccines) would be
made available to civilians on a voluntary basis. Nothing in
the Homeland Security Act would allow the Federal government to
mandate the administration of a covered countermeasure to
civilians.
The conferees concur with language in the Senate
explanatory statement urging the Director to move expeditiously
to analyze CDC's communication mechanisms and develop a
comprehensive plan to ensure the fast, accurate, and accessible
flow of information to the relevant health and public safety
professionals and to the public. The conferees request that the
Director report to the Committees on Appropriations within 6
months of enactment of this Act regarding the specific plan of
action resulting from this review.
The conferees understand that the CDC plans to study both
the health effects of anthrax exposure and of measures taken to
treat or prevent anthrax infection. The conferees request the
CDC report to the Committees within 90 days on its plan for
these studies.
Within the funds available to the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA) is $518,000,000 for Hospital
Preparedness and $28,000,000 to provide educational incentives
for medical school curriculum. The conferees encourage HRSA to
consider requiring that a statewide assessment of emergency
medical services preparedness needs in the event of a public
health emergency and a plan to address those needs be part of
the State application for hospital preparedness funds.
The agreement includes $2,000,000 within funds provided
to the Office of Public Health and Science for activities
related to the transformation and modernization of the Public
Health Service Commissioned Corps.
The conferees encourage the Department of Health and
Human Services to give priority to the study of plants as
vehicles for the production of vaccines.
The conferees request the Department to submit a report
to the Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment
of this Act detailing the amounts of fiscal year 2002 State and
Local Preparedness funds that:
(a) Each State spent, or plans to spend, to directly
benefit or improve local public health capacity; and
(b) The amount each State has directly granted to local
public health agencies.

percent subject to approval of the Appropriations Committees.
The traditional language is retained that permits the transfer
of funds appropriated for HHS in this Act and any other acts as
proposed by H.R. 246. The Senate bill proposed the transfer of
funds appropriated only under this Act.
REFUGEE STATUS OF CERTAIN PERSECUTED GROUPS
The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by

Health and Human Services released $200,000,000 in LIHEAP
emergency funds; this conference agreement includes a transfer
of the full $100,000,000 remaining in the emergency account to
the regular formula program. It is the intent of the conferees
that these funds, in addition to the $1,700,000,000 in new
budget authority provided in this Act, shall be allocated under
the regular state grant formula, providing a program level of
$1,800,000,000 for the fiscal year 2003.

proposed by H.R. 246 and $18,178,400,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The agreement includes advance funding for this account
of $9,027,301,000 instead of $6,883,301,000 as proposed by H.R.

Title I: Grants to LEAs
For Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) the
agreement provides $11,750,000,000 instead of $10,850,000,000
as proposed by H.R. 246 and $16,350,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The conference agreement includes $7,172,971,000 for
basic grants and $1,365,031,000 for concentration grants. The
agreement also includes $1,670,239,000 for targeted grants, and

$200,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

Literacy through School Libraries as proposed by H.R. 246
instead of $15,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Migrant and Neglected & Delinquent Education
The conference agreement includes $398,000,000 for the
migrant education program instead of $396,000,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246 and $400,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
agreement also includes $49,000,000 for neglected and
delinquent youth instead of $48,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246

Comprehensive School Reform
The conference agreement includes $235,000,000 for
comprehensive school reform (CSR) authorized under part F of
the No Child Left Behind Act as proposed by H.R. 246. The
Senate bill did not include funds for this activity.
The conferees urge the Department to work vigorously with
the States to ensure that States award CSR funds for those
comprehensive school reform models that have the strongest
evidence of positive effects on student achievement. In
addition, the conferees encourage the Department to clarify in
its guidance to States that middle and high schools, as well as
elementary schools, are eligible to receive CSR grants.
The conferees are concerned about the Department's delay
in the release of fiscal year 2002 funds--appropriated more
than a year ago--that are reserved for quality initiatives
under the comprehensive school reform program, as authorized
under section 1608 of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act. The conferees strongly urge the Department to
expeditiously make these funds available for these important
quality initiatives. These activities will expand the
availability of independent, credible, and timely information
to schools, districts and other consumers on the effectiveness
and quality of selected comprehensive school reforms. Further,
these activities will enhance the ability of providers of CSR
models to deliver services at a national scale (by providing
innovative financial support to improve educational services,
solid business planning, and other technical assistance). In
addition, the conferees expect the Department to utilize the
entire three percent set-aside authorized under section 1608 in
fiscal year 2003, to continue funding these quality improvement
activities, and to fund those organizations most suited to
carry out these activities. The conferees expect to be
consulted prior to the release of these funds for fiscal year
2003.
Dropout Prevention, Advanced Placement Fees and Migrant Programs
The conference agreement includes $11,000,000 for dropout
prevention programs, instead of $13,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. H.R. 246 did not provide funding for this program.

advanced placement fees instead of $22,000,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conference agreement also includes $23,500,000 for high school
equivalency program instead of $23,000,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and $15,500,000
for college assistance migrant program instead of $15,000,000
as proposed by H.R. 246 and $16,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate.

H.R. 246 and $1,176,500,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within
this amount, $1,032,000,000 is provided for basic support
payments instead of $1,022,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and
$1,012,500,000 as proposed by the Senate; $51,000,000 is

by the Senate; $45,000,000 is provided for construction as
proposed by H.R. 246 instead of $47,000,000 as proposed by the

Senate. The agreement provides $6,287,957,000 in fiscal year
2003 and $1,765,000,000 in fiscal year 2004 funding for this
account.
Improving Teacher Quality
The conference agreement includes $2,950,000,000 for
State grants for improving teacher quality as proposed by H.R.
246 instead of $2,850,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of
this amount, $1,150,000,000is provided as a fiscal year 2004
advance as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,650,000,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement also includes $12,500,000 for
school leadership activities instead of $10,000,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246 and $15,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The

and $24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate, and $62,500,000 for
teacher training in technology as proposed by the Senate, H.R.
246 did not include funding for this activity.
Safe and Drug Free Schools
The conference agreement includes $628,213,000 for the
Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act instead of
$644,250,000 as proposed by both H.R. 246 and the Senate.
Included within this amount is $472,017,000 for State
grants as proposed by H.R. 246 instead of $482,017,000 as

The conferees include $30,000,000 within the amount for
national programs for initiatives to improve school safety and
security, as proposed in the fiscal year 2003 request. These
funds should focus on strengthening school emergency response
and crisis management plans; training school personnel,
students and parents in emergency response procedures; and
coordinating with local law enforcement, public safety, health
and mental health agencies--continuing an initiative begun by
Congress in fiscal year 2002. The agreement also includes
$5,000,000 for Project SERV as proposed by the Senate instead
of $10,000,000 as proposed in H.R. 246.
Modifications made to the Safe and Drug Free Schools
Program in section 4114(a)(1) of the No Child Left Behind Act
may have created dramatic changes in funding for some LEAs. The
conferees understand that no data have been compiled to show
the nationwide breakdown of these funding changes at the LEA
level. Therefore, the conferees request that the Department
gather this information and report back to Congress no later
than May 1, 2004 with its findings.
Credit Enhancement for Charter Schools
The conference agreement includes $25,000,000 for credit
enhancement for charter schools instead of $50,000,000 as

program to be used for construction, renovation and
modernization of any elementary school, secondary school, or
structure related to an elementary school or secondary school
run by the Department of Education of the State of Hawaii that
serves a predominantly Native Hawaiian student body. Neither
H.R. 246 nor the Senate bill contained this provision. The
conferees urge the Department to provide $500,000 for school
construction/renovation and at least $500,000 for early
childhood education.
Alaska Native Educational Equity
The conference agreement includes $31,000,000 for the

as proposed by the Senate and $14,200,000 as proposed by H.R.

this program to be used for construction. Neither H.R. 246 nor
the Senate bill contained this provision.

education programs, instead of $162,500,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $175,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE)
The conference agreement includes $814,660,000 for the
Fund for the Improvement of Education.
Within the total for FIE, the conference agreement
includes funding for the following activities in the following
amounts:
Character Education.....................................   $25,000,000
Reading is Fundamental..................................   25,500,000
School Counseling.......................................   32,500,000
Javits Gifted and Talented Education....................   11,250,000
Star Schools............................................   27,520,000
Ready to Teach..........................................   14,500,000
Foreign Language Assistance.............................   16,250,000
Carol M. White Physical Education for Progress..........   60,000,000
Community Based Technology Centers......................   32,475,000
Exchanges with Historic Whaling and Trading Partners....    7,000,000
Parental Assistance Information Centers.................   42,500,000
Women's Educational Equity..............................    3,000,000
The conference agreement includes $75,000,000 for
comprehensive school reform grants to local educational
agencies as proposed by H.R. 246. The Senate bill did not
include funding for this activity. These funds shall support
grants to States for continuing and new subgrants to local
educational agencies for comprehensive school reform activities
in both title 1 and non-title 1 eligible schools. The bill
includes language specifying that these funds shall be
allocated and expended in the same manner as in fiscal year
2002 and provides the funds on a forward funding basis.
The conference agreement also includes $1,639,000 for
continuation funding for the national clearinghouse on
comprehensive school reform.
The conference agreement also includes $162,000,000 for
the smaller learning communities program, instead of
$142,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The Senate did not
include funding for this program. As in past years, the
conference agreement provides the funds on a forward funded
basis and specifies that these funds shall be used only for
activities related to the redesign of large high schools
enrolling 1,000 or more students.
The conferees are concerned that the Department did not
consult with the Appropriations Committees on the fiscal year
2002 program guidance and application for the smaller learning
communities program as requested in House Report 107-229. The
conferees do not agree with the competitive preference for
certain grant applicants proposed by the Department for the
fiscal year 2002 competition and direct the Secretary to revise
the grant application to remove this preference. The conferees
believe that applicants for assistance under this program
should be evaluated solely on the quality of their proposals to
improve the learning environment for students within their
current educational setting. The program guidance should also
clarify that smaller learning community funds may be used to
support the initial planning for, and operation of, new small
schools as well as the redesign of existing schools into
smaller learning units.
The conferees are also concerned about the Department's
inability to hold timely grant competitions for this program in
fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The fiscal year 2001 grant
competition was delayed, and the 2002 grant competition is far
behind schedule. Accordingly, the conferees direct the
Department to publish the smaller learning communities program
application for fiscal year 2002 grants not later than February
28, 2003. If the Department is unable to meet this deadline,
the conferees request a letter report from the Department to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by that date,
which explains why the Department is unable to meet this
deadline, indicates when the Department will announce the
fiscal year 2002 competition, and outlines the steps the
Department will take to prevent delays in the fiscal year 2003
smaller learning communities grant competition.
The conferees have a strong interest in this program and
are displeased that the Department has not only failed to
consult with the Appropriations Committees, but also has not
responded to requests for basic information about how program
funds will be utilized. The conferees expect that the
Department will consult fully with the Appropriations
Committees prior to the release of the fiscal year 2003 program
guidance for the smaller learning communities program. Further,
the Department should develop a balanced plan for outreach,
networking, and technical assistance activities during fiscal
year 2003 to ensure that school districts are aware that small
schools and smaller learning communities are effective,
research-based strategies to improve academic achievement,
attendance, and safety. The Department should be prepared to
discuss these matters during hearings on its fiscal year 2004
budget request.
For Arts in Education, the conference agreement includes
$34,000,000 instead of $36,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
H.R. 246 did not specify separate funding for this line item.
The conferees provide that within this total, $7,000,000 is for
Very Special Arts, $6,000,000 is for the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts, and $1,500,000 is to be used to
continue a youth violence prevention initiative. In addition,
$4,000,000 is for cultural partnerships, $6,500,000 is for
model professional development programs for music, drama, dance
and visual arts educators and $500,000 is for evaluation
activities. The remaining $8,500,000 is available to continue
model arts programs. The conferees have made significant
investments over the past couple of years in funding model arts
programs, professional development activities and cultural
partnerships for at risk youth. The conferees intend that the
$500,000 provided for evaluation shall be used to begin
reviewing and evaluating competitive grants funded through this
program. The conferees further intend that information about
best practices and model programs identified during this review
and evaluation process should be disseminated widely, in order
to maximize the significant benefits of these targeted
investments.
The conference agreement includes $15,000,000 for teacher
quality initiatives, as requested by the Administration. The
conferees intend that these funds be awarded for initiatives
such as the following: to identify research-based competencies
that all new teachers should possess and to develop related,
rigorous assessments; to infuse research-based reading
instruction into pre-service teacher preparation programs; to
provide technical assistance to alternative route programs to
ensure quality; to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of
mentoring and professional development to teachers entering the
profession via alternative route programs and to identify the
retention rates of those teachers; and to identify issues
relating to teacher mobility. The conferees share the
Administration's interest in initiatives to improve teacher
quality and request that theDepartment provide the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations with a detailed summary of the
types of projects proposed to be supported prior to any funds being
awarded.

provided:

conference agreement includes $1,000,000 to support programs
designed to improve the quality of applied orthotic and
prosthetic research and help meet the increasing demand for

be used to support an orthotics and prosthetic awareness
campaign, consisting of an educational outreach initiative
designed to recruit and retain professionals and a series of
consensus conferences to develop and disseminate best practices
in the field.
The agreement also includes $39,629,000 for training as

Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights instead of
$15,200,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $17,500,000 as proposed

The conference agreement includes $70,000,000 for
Independent Living Centers as proposed by H.R. 246 instead of
$69,500,000 as proposed by the Senate. The agreement also
includes $28,000,000 for services for older blind individuals
as proposed by the Senate instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by

The conference agreement includes $27,000,000 for
assistive technology as proposed by the Senate instead of
$30,884,000 as proposed in H.R. 246. The agreement also
includes language allowing States which have received assistive
technology extension grants in the past and are scheduled to be
phased out of the program to continue to receive an award in
fiscal year 2003 at the fiscal year 2002 level. This language
is provided to allow time for the authorizing committees of
jurisdiction to review the program in the context of
reauthorizing the Assistive Technology Act. The conferees are
aware that this program was originally designed to be ``seed
money'' to develop assistive technology activities at the State
level. The authorizing statute specifies that the State grant
portion of the program would sunset after ten years, giving
States time to develop their own programs in this area. The
conferees encourage States to increase their support for
protection and advocacy activities in planning their
distribution of resources in the area of assistive technology.
The conferees are pleased that the National Institute on
Disability and Rehabilitation Research has recognized chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) as an unmet area of research and is
funding a CFS research study. The conferees encourage NIDRR to
continue to pursue CFS-related research proposals through its
investigator-initiated and other grants programs.

National Technical Institute for the Deaf instead of
$53,500,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $54,600,000 as proposed
by the Senate. The agreement also includes language proposed by
the Senate allowing NTID to use funds from the total for the
endowment program at its discretion instead of language
proposed by H.R. 246 specifying that not less than $1,000,000
shall be for the endowment program and available until
expended.
Gallaudet University
The conference agreement includes $98,438,000 for
Gallaudet University as proposed by the Senate instead of
$95,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The agreement also
includes language proposed by the Senate allowing Gallaudet to
use funds from the total for the endowment program at its
discretion instead of language proposed by H.R. 246 specifying
that not less than $1,000,000 shall be for the endowment
program and available until expended.
Vocational and Adult Education
The conference agreement includes $1,956,060,000 for
Vocational and Adult Education instead of $1,919,560,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and $1,938,060,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The agreement provides $1,165,060,000 in fiscal year

Vocational Education basic state grants as proposed by H.R. 246
instead of $1,180,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees continue to believe that technical
institutes play an important role in developing a highly-
skilled workforce, and that these institutes should have equal
access to vocational and technical education funding. The
conferees encourage the Department and the authorizing
committees of jurisdiction to consider approaches to ensuring
such equal access when developing their reauthorization
proposals for the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act, which is due to be reauthorized this
year.
The conference agreement includes $108,000,000 for Tech
Prep as proposed by the Senate, instead of $110,000,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 for Tribally
Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions as proposed by
the Senate instead of $6,500,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The
agreement also includes language proposed by the Senate
notwithstanding any other provision of law or any regulation
that the Secretary of Education shall not require the use of a
restricted indirect cost rate for grants issued pursuant to the
tribally controlled postsecondary vocational and technical
institutions program. H.R. 246 did not contain this provision.
The agreement also includes $9,500,000 to continue the
occupational and employment information program instead of
$10,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 did not include
funding for this activity.
The conference agreement includes $5,000,000 for the
tech-prep education demonstration authorized under section 207
of the Perkins Act as proposed by the Senate. The agreement
also includes $23,500,000 for State Grants for Incarcerated
Youth instead of $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. H.R.
246 did not provide funding for these activities.
Student Financial Assistance
The conference agreement includes $13,450,500,000 for
Student Financial Assistance instead of $13,171,610,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and $13,151,500,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The agreement provides a program level of $11,439,000,000
for Pell Grants instead of $11,200,110,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $11,180,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
agreement also increases the maximum Pell Grant to $4,050 for
award year 2003-2004 instead of $4,000 as proposed by H.R. 246
and $4,100 as proposed by the Senate. Additional funds are
included within the appropriation for the Pell Grant program to
continue to pay down the shortfall that has been accumulating
in the program over the past two fiscal years.
The conferees are aware that many postsecondary
institutions are struggling to make the most efficient use
possible of their facilities as they prepare for enrollments
that will grow by more than two million students over the next
decade. Under the Department of Education's current practice,
however, students may receive only one Pell Grant in a calendar
year, limiting low-income students' ability to enroll year
round. In the House report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2002
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act, the Committee requested that the
Department submit a report, not later than March 1, 2002, on
the feasibility and cost of conducting a demonstration program
under Section 487(A)(b) of the Higher Education Act to provide
two Pell Grants in one calendar year to students at selected
institutions of higher education. The conferees note that the
Department has failed to provide this report and again request
that the Department provide this report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on Education
and the Workforce, and the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions no later than May 1, 2003.
The conference agreement also includes $765,000,000 for
the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants program instead
of $725,000,000 as proposed by both H.R. 246 and the Senate.
The conferees continue to be concerned about issues
within the consolidation loan program. The conferees are aware
that some borrowers would like to see the current law changed
to allow for consolidation with any lender or holder,
regardless of how many lenders with whom the borrower has
loans. The conferees are concerned that without change to the
current law governing consolidation loans, some borrowers may
not be permitted to consolidate their loans with any lender
they choose. The leaders of the authorizing committees have
expressed a desire to address this and other issues during the
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act so as to address
the Consolidation Loan Program as a whole. The conferees urge
those committees to ensure borrowers have the best options
available to them in order to manage their student loan
obligations.
Higher Education
The conference agreement includes $2,100,701,000 for
Higher Education instead of $1,903,553,000 as proposed by H.R.
246 and $2,047,640,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Aid for institutional development
The conference agreement includes $82,000,000 for
strengthening institutions as proposed by the Senate instead of
$76,275,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The agreement also
includes $93,000,000 for Hispanic Serving Institutions as
proposed by the Senate instead of $89,096,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246.
The conference agreement includes $215,415,000 for

proposed by the Senate instead of $213,415,000 as proposed by

of $18,130,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. The conferees agree
that the funds provided shall be used to support continuation
of existing basic grants and new planning or implementation
grant awards. The remaining funds shall be available for grants
for renovation and construction of facilities to help address
urgently needed facilities repair and expansion.
Fund for the improvement of postsecondary education

International Education and Foreign Language Studies
Domestic Programs
The conference agreement includes $93,850,000 for the
domestic activities of the international education and foreign
languages studiesprograms instead of $85,200,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $87,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference
agreement will sustain the investments made last year to train experts
who have foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills in the
targeted world areas of Central and South Asia, the Middle East,
Russia, and the Independent States of the former Soviet Union, and
provide new resources to build foreign language capacity and
international expertise in these strategic world areas important to
national security interests and other areas, including southeast Asia
and Africa.
The conferees are aware that all national resource
centers will compete for new awards in fiscal year 2003. The
conference agreement includes sufficient funds to increase the
average award for the existing number (118) of centers by at
least nine percent. The conferees believe that restoring awards
that have eroded over the years, thereby enabling each center
to implement an effective, multifaceted program of advanced
language training, research, technical assistance, and
outreach, should be a priority over expanding the number of
centers over current levels.
The conference agreement also includes sufficient funds
for an additional 87 academic and 70 summer fellowships under
the foreign language and area studies fellowships program over
the request. These fellowships should be allocated across all
world areas, with an emphasis on languages of strategic
national importance.
The conference agreement includes sufficient funds for
the language resource centers for new K-16 teacher training
initiatives in the less commonly taught foreign languages
critical to national security, including the development of a
strategic plan for teacher training and resource development, a
summit on teacher training, professional development through
summer institutes for K-16 teachers of Arabic, Azeri, Persian/
Dari, Pashto, Uzbek, Urdu and other languages of strategic
importance, and assistance to K-16 teachers for the development
of web-delivered instructional materials. The conference
agreement includes sufficient funds to provide an increase for
the centers for international business to address issues
relating to homeland security and trade.
In conducting new competitions in all Title VI program
areas in fiscal year 2003, the Department should continue to
emphasize increased investments in areas of strategic national
importance. The conference agreement continues language to
allow up to one percent of funds to be used for program
evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination
activities.
The conferees are disappointed that the Department has
not fully addressed the staffing needs of the Title VI and
Fulbright-Hays international education programs. The conferees
note that the Department's full-time equivalent (FTE) staffing
level will increase by 79 FTE in fiscal year 2003.
Overseas program
The conference agreement provides $13,000,000 for the
overseas programs in international education and foreign
language studies authorized under section 102(b)(6) of the
Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 as
proposed by the Senate instead of $11,800,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246. Funding for these programs supports group projects
abroad, faculty research abroad, special bilateral projects,
and doctoral dissertation research abroad. The additional
funding provided over the request should be used to expand
research fellowships and group projects abroad in intermediate
and advanced language training in newly strategic world areas,
and enhance curriculum development and summer seminars abroad
for K-12 teachers. The conference agreement continues language
allowing section 102(b)(6) funds for individuals planning to
apply their advanced language skills in the fields of
government, the professions, or international development.
Institute for International Public Policy
The conference agreement includes $1,650,000 for the
Institute for International Public Policy instead of $1,500,000
as proposed by both H.R. 246 and the Senate. This program
provides a grant to the United Negro College Fund to operate
the Institute through sub-grantees chosen among minority-
serving institutions. The conferees encourage the Institute to
continue a recent emphasis on helping students obtain foreign
language competence and international expertise in areas
important to national security.
Minority Science and Engineering Improvement
The conference agreement includes $9,000,000 for minority
science and engineering improvement instead of $8,500,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and $9,500,000 as proposed by the Senate.
TRIO
The conference agreement includes $832,500,000 for TRIO
as proposed by the Senate instead of $810,000,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246.
The conferees are concerned that the regulatory
definitions of ``different campus'' and ``different population
of participants'' in the Student Support Services Program
regulations (34 CFR Part 646.7(c)) are so narrowly crafted that
the definitions undermine Congressional intent and prohibit
many geographically separate institutions from applying for
TRIO funding and, thus, prohibit the expansion of educational
opportunities for more low-income and minority students.
The conferees direct the Department to review these
regulatory definitions and make the appropriate changes so that
more institutions of higher education, particularly those that
have large numbers of low-income students enrolled at various
campuses, will have the ability to apply for TRIO grants and
serve more eligible students who need TRIO services.
GEAR UP
The conference agreement includes $295,000,000 for GEAR
UP as proposed by the Senate instead of $285,000,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246.
Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants
The conference agreement also includes $90,000,000 for
Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants as proposed by the Senate
instead of $100,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
Child Care Access Means Parents in School
The conference agreement includes $16,300,000 for the
child care access program as proposed by the Senate instead of
$15,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.
Other higher education programs
The conference agreement includes $7,000,000 for
Demonstrations in Disability as proposed by the Senate. H.R.
246 did not include separate funding for this activity. The
conference agreement includes $2,250,000 for the Underground
Railroad Educational and Cultural Program instead of $2,500,000
as proposed by the Senate and $2,000,000 as proposed by H.R.
246. The conference agreement also includes $5,000,000 for
Thurgood Marshall Scholarships as proposed by the Senate
instead of $4,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $1,000,000
for Olympic Scholarships as proposed by H.R. 246. The Senate
bill did not provide funding for this program.
Howard University
The conference agreement includes $240,000,000 for Howard
University as proposed by H.R. 246 instead of $239,974,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Institute of Education Sciences
The conference agreement includes $450,887,000 for the
Institute of Education Sciences instead of $397,887,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and $397,387,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees provide $140,000,000 for research as
proposed by H.R. 246 instead of $89,500,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Within this total, the conference agreement includes
$19,635,000 in continuation funding for comprehensive school
reform evaluation, research, model development and
dissemination activities as requested by the Department.
The conferees strongly support the premise that
developing, identifying and implementing scientifically based
research is critical to the success of the No Child Left Behind
Act and to the increased effectiveness generally of education
programs and interventions. In particular, the conferees
believe that a greater focus must be placed on the use of
randomized controlled trials, longitudinal studies, and other
research that meets the standards set by the National Research
Council. The development of an enhanced research infrastructure
will help build a base of research-proven interventions that
can be used by educational institutions to help improve the
educational outcomes of our nation's student population. The
conferees have provided an additional $18,183,000 above last
year to continue building the nation's educational research
infrastructure. The conferees note that there is a lack of
scientifically based education research, such as randomized
research trials.
The conferees provide $90,000,000 for statistics instead
of $95,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and $87,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement also includes $58,000,000 to
continue multi-year grants and contracts for Comprehensive
Regional Assistance Centers, Regional Math and Science
Education Consortia, the Math and Science Clearinghouse, and
Technology-based technical assistance as proposed by the
Senate. H.R. 246 did not include funding for these activities.
The conferees are concerned with recent statistics that
show that more than 20 million children experience reading
failure. According to the National Center for Education
Statistics, almost 40% of America's fourth graders suffer with
reading difficulties. It has been brought to the attention of
the conferees that the Haan Reading Institute has developed a
national research project to measure the effectiveness of
selected remedial reading programs and their ability to
normalize reading skills for children in the late elementary
and early secondary grades. The information derived from this
research will be used by parents, teachers and policymakers to
understand the different reading profiles of children and to
determine which instructional methods work best for whom. The
conferees encourage the Department to give consideration to
this research project.
Departmental Management
The conference agreement includes $412,545,000 for
Departmental program administration instead of $412,093,000 as
proposed by the Senate and $411,795,000 as proposed by H.R.
246.
The conferees are concerned about the delay applicants
are experiencing in receiving awards under grant programs and
therefore request that the Department provide a report within
60 days of enactment of this bill on the steps that it can take
to reduce the delay in administering grant competitions.
The conferees have included $750,000 to provide all Title
IV institutions that are eligible for funding with a handbook
providing detailed instruction on compliance with section
485(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, relating to campus
crime statistics.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Reading First Supplement not Supplant
The conference agreement includes an amendment to the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to insert a

Sense of the Senate that every effort should be made to fund
the after-school programs at the level authorized in the No
Child Left Behind Act as proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246
contained no similar provision.
Title IV--Related Agencies
Armed Forces Retirement Home
The conference agreement includes $68,013,000 for the
Armed Forces Retirement Home instead of $67,340,000 as proposed
by H.R. 246 and the Senate. The conferees have included
sufficient funds to offset the effects of the across-the-board
cut on salaries and expenses.
The conferees have also agreed to include provisions
relating to contracts for development and construction as
proposed by the Senate. H.R. 246 contained no similar
provisions.
Corporation for National and Community Service

Senate.

Volunteers in Homeland Security as proposed by the Senate
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. Of this total,
up to $5,000,000 is available to support the Parent Drug Corps
program.
National Senior Volunteer Corps
The conference agreement includes $111,500,000 for the
Foster Grandparent Program (FGP) as proposed by H.R. 246
instead of $106,700,000 as proposed by the Senate.
One-third of the increases provided for the FGP, SCP, and
RSVP programs shall be used to fund Programs of National
Significance expansion grants to allow existing FGP, RSVP and
SCP programs to expand the number of volunteers serving in
areas of critical need as identified by Congress in the
Domestic Volunteer Service Act.
Sufficient funding has been included to provide an
increase for administrative costs realized by all current
grantees in the FGP, SCP and RSVP programs. Funds remaining
above these amounts should be used to begin new FGP, RSVP and
SCP programs in geographic areas currently unserved. The
conferees expect these projects to be awarded via a nationwide
competition among potential community-based sponsors.
The Corporation for National and Community Service shall
comply with the directive that use of funding increases in the
Foster Grandparent Program, Retired and Senior Volunteer
Program and VISTA not be restricted to America Reads
activities. The conferees further direct that the Corporation
shall not stipulate a minimum or maximum amount for PNS grant
augmentations.
The conference agreement includes $400,000 for senior
demonstration activities as proposed by both the Senate. These
funds are to be used solely to carry out evaluations and to
provide recruitment, training, and technical assistance to
local projects as described in the budget request. No new
demonstration projects may be begun with these funds. None of
the increases provided for FGP, SCP, or RSVP in fiscal year
2003 may be used for demonstration activities.
Funds appropriated for fiscal year 2003 may not be used
to implement or support service collaboration agreements or any
other changes in the administration and/or governance of
national service programs prior to passage of a bill by the
authorizing committees of jurisdiction specifying such changes.
Program Administration
The conference agreement includes $34,571,000 for program
administration instead of $34,229,000 as proposed by both H.R.
246 and the Senate. The conferees have included sufficient
funds to offset the effects of the across-the-board cut on
salaries and expenses.
Corporation for Public Broadcasting
The conference agreement provides $390,000,000 in funding
for fiscal year 2005, instead of $380,000,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and $395,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees have included sufficient funds to offset
the effects of the across-the-board cut on salaries and
expenses.
The conferees strongly urge the CPB to allocate not less
than $100,000 to the 14 public radio stations around the nation
that provide the sole source of radio news and information in
their communities. The additional funds would permit these
stations to extend their broadcast hours and improve service to
their listeners.
The conference agreement also includes $48,744,000 for
equipment and facilities to enable public broadcasters to meet
the statutory deadline for digital conversion as proposed by
the Senate instead of $25,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246.

conferees have included sufficient funds to offset the effects
of the across-the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
Institute of Museum and Library Services

proposed by the Senate. The conferees have included sufficient
funds to offset the effects of the across-the-board cut on

Medicare Payment Advisory Commission
Salaries and Expenses
The conference agreement includes $8,585,000 for the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, instead of $8,250,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate. The conferees have
included sufficient funds to offset the effects of the across-
the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $1,010,000 for the
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
instead of $1,000,000 as proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate.
The conferees have included sufficient funds to offset the
effects of the across-the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
National Council on Disability
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $2,858,000 for the
National Council on Disability, instead of $2,830,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 and the Senate. The conferees have
included sufficient funds to offset the effects of the across-
the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
National Labor Relations Board
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides $238,982,000 for the
National Labor Relations Board instead of $226,618,000 as
proposed by H.R. 246 or $238,223,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees have included sufficient funds to offset the
effects of the across-the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
National Mediation Board
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $11,315,000 for the
National Mediation Board, instead of $11,203,000 as proposed by
H.R. 246 and the Senate. The conferees have included sufficient
funds to offset the effects of the across-the-board cut on
salaries and expenses.
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission

The conference agreement provides $9,673,000 for the
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission instead of
$9,577,000 as proposed by both H.R. 246 and the Senate. The
conferees have included sufficient funds to offset the effects
of the across-the-board cut on salaries and expenses.
Railroad Retirement Board Limitation on Administration
The conference agreement includes $100,000,000 for the

proposed by the Senate. The conferees have included sufficient
funds to offset the effects of the across-the-board cut on
salaries and expenses.
Given that trust funds are collected from railroad
workers for the specific purpose of maintaining and

trust funds should not be used for the purpose of paying rent
in excess of actual cost. Therefore, no funds have been
included for that purpose.
Railroad Retirement Board Limitation on the Office of Inspector General
The conference agreement includes a limitation on
transfers from the railroad trust funds of $6,363,000 for

programs. H.R. 246 contained no similar provision.

The conference agreement includes $24,025,392,000 for the
Supplemental Security Income Program as proposed by the Senate
instead of $24,017,392,000 as proposed by H.R. 246. Within the
funds provided, the conference agreement includes $8,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate for outreach efforts and assistance to
homeless persons and other underserved populations.

The conferees have included sufficient funds to offset the
effects of the across-the-board cut on salaries and expenses.

United States Institute of Peace
The conference agreement includes a provision proposed by
the Senate pertaining to the date on or before which an
independent public accountant must be certified or licensed to
perform the annual audit of the United States Institute of
Peace (USIP). The conference agreement does not include a
provision proposed by the Senate that extends the authorization
of the USIP for one additional year. H.R. 246 did not contain
similar provisions.

DIVISION H--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS, 2003
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WIDE MATTERS
The conferees direct the legislative branch entities to
establish a legislative branch chief administrative officers
council that will meet regularly on administrative issues of
concern to the legislative branch. Such a council is to be
modeled after the Legislative Branch Financial Managers
Council. Wherever a chief administrative officer does not exist
in a legislative branch entity, a senior-level employee should
be designated to serve in this capacity. Through this council,
representatives will be able to define, review and discuss
policies, security issues, mail issues, personnel practices,
procedures and systems for such areas as human resources,
information technology, and general management. This will
facilitate consistency in systems development wherever
appropriate, sharing of ``lessons learned,'' and the
elimination of duplicative efforts. The conferees direct the
General Accounting Office to work with the agencies of the
legislative branch to establish the council and the council and
GAO must be prepared to report to the Committees on
Appropriations of the Senate and the House during the annual
budget hearing process beginning with fiscal year 2005.
The conferees recognize the provisions of H.R. 5121 and
House Report 107-576 and any instructions and detail included
in such report are to be adhered to, unless amended or restated
herein.
Many items in both House and Senate Legislative Branch
Appropriations bills are identical and are included in the
conference agreement without change. The conferees have
endorsed statements of policy contained in the House and Senate
reports accompanying the appropriations bills, unless amended
or restated herein. With respect to those items in the
conference agreement that differ between House and Senate
bills, the conferees have agreed to the following with the
appropriate section numbers, punctuation, and other technical
corrections:
TITLE I--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS
Senate
Appropriates $667,788,000 for Senate operations. Inasmuch
as these items relate solely to the Senate, and in accord with
long practice under which each body determines its own
housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without
intervention, the managers on the part of the House, at the
request of the managers on the part of the Senate, have receded
to the amendments of the Senate.
House of Representatives
Appropriates $956,086,000 for House operations. Inasmuch
as these items relate solely to the House, and in accord with
long practice under which each body determines its own
housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without
intervention, the managers on the part of the Senate, at the
request of the managers on the part of the House, have receded
to the amendments of the House.
The managers on the part of the House encourage the Chief
Administrative Officer (CAO) to contract with an organization
that is very familiar with the House, the operations and
activities of House offices, and the personnel that work in
these offices, to assess the professional development needs of
the House workforce. The CAO should report the findings to the
Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on House
Administration.
JOINT ITEMS
Joint Economic Committee
Appropriates $3,658,000 for the Joint Economic Committee
as proposed by the House and by the Senate.
Joint Committee on Taxation
Appropriates $7,643,000 for the Joint Committee on
Taxation instead of $7,323,000 as proposed by the House and the
Senate.
Office of the Attending Physician
Appropriates $3,000,000 for the Office of the Attending
Physician as proposed by the House and by the Senate, of which
$300,000 shall be available until expended. This amount
includes $1,414,000 for reimbursement to the Department of Navy
for expenses incurred as proposed by the House and by the
Senate.
Capitol Guide Service and Special Services Office
Appropriates $3,035,000 for the Capitol Guide Service and
Special Services Office as proposed by the House and by the
Senate.
Statement of Appropriations
Appropriates $30,000 for Statement of Appropriations as
proposed by the House and by the Senate.
CAPITOL POLICE
Salaries
Appropriates $175,675,000 for salaries of officers,
members, and employees of the Capitol Police. The conferees
direct the Chief of the Capitol Police make retroactive to the
first full pay period in October 2002 any comparability
adjustment in pay.
The conferees direct that not later than 120 days after
enactment of this Act, the Capitol Police Board report to the
Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, the Committee on Rules and Administration of
the Senate, and the Committee on House Administration on a
proposed new pay structure, the budgetary impact of the
proposed structure, and a detailed plan of how the proposed
structure would be implemented which is consistent with the
requirements of P.L. 105-55.
The FY 2001 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, as
amended (P.L. 106-346), required the General Accounting Office
(GAO) to participate in the selection of a Chief Administrative
Officer (CAO) for the United States Capitol Police (USCP) and
monitor the implementation of management improvements in
budgeting, financial management, information technology, and
human resources. The law required GAO to provide quarterly
reports to the Chief of the Capitol Police, Capitol Police
Board, and congressional appropriations and oversight
committees having jurisdiction over the Capitol Police through
September 30, 2002 on USCP's implementation efforts. Much
progress has been made by the CAO to improve overall
administrative operations of the Capitol Police. However, there
are still some significant concerns on the part of the
conferees about the need for the USCP to update their strategic
plan to reflect post-September 11, 2001 changes, and to
implement an effective management strategy in the agency,
particularly with respect to human resources. Therefore, the
conferees direct the GAO to continue monitoring all CAO
operations of the USCP, with special attention to the strategic
planning process and human resources management. GAO is
directed to provide to the Capitol Police and congressional
committees noted above semi-annual reports on the CAO's
continued implementation of management improvements in
budgeting, financial management, information technology,
developing and implementing an effective overall strategic
planning process and human resource management strategy. The
conferees direct that these reports continue through FY 2006.
In the wake of September 11, 2001, security concerns led
to the posting of signs prohibiting bicyclists on the Capitol
grounds. The Capitol grounds have been a link to Capitol Hill,
the National Mall and downtown for years and bicycling is a
form of transportation that helps alleviate traffic congestion,
promotes physical activity, and does not contribute to air
pollution. The conferees urge the Capitol Police and the
Architect of the Capitol to work with the District Department
of Transportation to create safe routes for bicyclists in and/
or around the Capitol grounds in a manner that encourages
bicycling without sacrificing security concerns. The upcoming
year is a critical time for this planning to take place as the
construction of the Capitol Visitors Center progresses and the
City of Washington updates its Bike Master Plan. The Capitol
Police and the Architect of the Capitol should report to the
Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House on a
plan of action to coordinate with the District Department of
Transportation on addressing this issue.
General Expenses
Appropriates $28,100,000, of which $1,400,000 shall
remain available until expended for general expenses of the
Capitol Police.
Administrative Provisions
The conferees have included an administrative provision
allowing for the transfer of funds upon the approval of the
Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. In
addition, the conferees have included provisions that authorize
the Capitol Police to: procure severable services; dispose of
surplus or obsolete property; hire without regard to age;
establish an educational assistance program; expand the current
training program; centralize their disbursing authority;
annualize premium pay limits; provide overtime compensation to
Lieutenants and above; appoint special officers and establish
specialty assignment pay. In addition, the conferees have
included technical corrections to existing recruitment and
relocation incentives, and for compensation of the Chief of
Police, the Assistant Chief of Police, and the Chief
Administrative Officer. Language is included which redefines
the mission and the composition of the Capitol Police Board;
provides for the merger of the Capitol Police with the Library
of Congress Police; and, clarifies the authority of the Capitol
Police to police the Botanic Garden. Language is also included
which permits the Capitol Police to appoint employees at a rate
of pay at or above step one of the pay grade in which the
employee is appointed. In addition, language has been included
which directs the regulations and approvals of various
provisions be completed within sixty days of enactment of this
Act. The conferees have also directed the development of a
long-term strategic plan.
Office of Compliance
Appropriates $2,059,000 for the Office of Compliance as
proposed by the House and the Senate. Authority has been
provided for the Executive Director of the Office of Compliance
to dispose of surplus or obsolete property.
The Office of Compliance was established as an
independent office within the Legislative Branch to implement
and enforce the provisions of the Congressional Accountability
Act of 1995. The principal functions of the Office include
enforcing 11 civil rights, labor, and workplace laws within the
Legislative Branch, which entails administering a procedure to
resolve disputes and to provide remedies if violations are
found; carrying out an education program for congressional
Members, employing entities of the Legislative Branch, and
employees with regard to the provision of the laws applied to
the Legislative Branch; and compiling and publishing statistics
on the use of Office by covered employees.
Federal standards of internal and management controls and
prevailing best practices for governing call for periodically
reviewing an organization's structure, functions (i.e., mission
and roles), and processes to (1) determine whether they are
functioning well, and ensure that they reflect changes in
circumstances and (2) ensure sound governance, oversight, and
accountability. Since its creation, no comprehensive review of
the Office of Compliance and its operations has been conducted.
Thus, the conferees direct the General Accounting Office to
assess the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Office
of Compliance in fulfilling its responsibilities and role in
achieving the overall intent and purposes of the Congressional
Accountability Act. The review should include examining the
effectiveness and efficiency of the Office's administration and
enforcement of the Act and the administrative and judicial
dispute-resolution procedures for considering alleged
violations of the laws; the operations of the Board of
Directors; and the assistance and services provided by the
Office to employing offices of the Legislative Branch in
fulfilling their responsibilities under the Act. The GAO should
make recommendations, as appropriate, to enhance the overall
effectiveness and efficiency of the Office of Compliance to
achieve the purposes of the Act. The GAO should report its
findings to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and
Senate by March 31, 2003.
Congressional Budget Office
Appropriates $32,101,000 for salaries and expenses of the
Congressional Budget Office as proposed by the Senate instead
of $32,390,000 as proposed by the House.
Administrative Provisions
Language has been included authorizing employees of the
CBO to engage in details or other temporary assignments to
other government agencies for study and work experience. In
addition, a provision has been included regarding the purchases
and contracts made by the Congressional Budget Office.
ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL
General Administration
Appropriates $59,343,000 for Architect of the Capitol,
general administration. Of the amount appropriated $450,000
shall remain available until September 30, 2007.
The conferees expect the Architect of the Capitol to
continue to observe closely limitations on full-time equivalent
(FTE) positions. It is noted, however, that funding was
provided for various projects with no commensurate increase in
the FTE ceiling. Accordingly, the conferees provide relief from
the fiscal year 2003 FTE ceiling for delivery of those projects
under the condition that the Committees on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives and Senate be notified prior to
the increase in the FTE ceiling.
The conferees have provided a new budget line item under
various accounts for Design, Study and Condition Assessment of
projects. The Architect of the Capitol is to notify the
Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate 21 days prior to moving forward with these
projects.
The Architect of the Capitol is to report semi-annually
to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of
Representatives and the Senate on the expenditure of funds for
attendance at meetings and conventions.
The conferees note the completion of the General
Management Review (GMR) of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC)
conducted by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and commend
the Architect for his willingness to effect recommended changes
in the AOC's management policies and practices. The conferees
believe that the continued involvement of the GAO throughout
the Architect's development and implementation of a plan that
effects GMR recommendations will be of considerable value.
Therefore, the conferees direct the GAO to monitor the
Architect on the development and implementation of the required
plan. In addition, the GAO is to monitor the establishment of
various positions to implement the plan. The conferees also
direct the GAO to evaluate implementation efforts as well as
the results of management changes, including the timely
accomplishment of the implementation plan milestones, and
report the results of that evaluation semi-annually to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and the Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration. These reports should
continue until all changes in the plan have been implemented.
Section 133 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act,
2002 (P.L. 107-68) generally prohibits the Architect of the
Capitol from employing temporary workers for long periods
without providing them eligibility for employee benefits.
During the implementation of Section 133, questions arose
concerning its application to temporary workers covered by
collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Architect
providing eligibility for private-sector employee benefits in
lieu of federal benefits. The conferees direct the Architect to
work with the General Accounting Office to determine the proper
manner of completing the implementation of Section 133 and to
consult with the Internal Revenue Service concerning the proper
tax treatment of benefits and contributions. The Architect is
directed to report to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees, and the Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration on the results of his efforts by May 31, 2003.

Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-554) renaming the former

TITLE I
Department of Transportation
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
The conferees agree that Executive Branch propensities
cannot substitute for Congress' own statements concerning the
best evidence of Congressional intentions; that is, the
official reports of the Congress. The committee of conference
approves report language included by the House (House Report
107-722) or the Senate (as delineated materials accompanying
Senate Amendment No. 1 to H.J. Res. 2 and printed in the
Congressional Record of January 15, 2003) that is not changed
by the conference. The statement of the managers, while
repeating some report language for emphasis, is not intended to
negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided
herein.
Office of the Secretary
(SALARIES AND EXPENSES)
The conference agreement provides $89,447,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the office of the secretary instead of
$82,474,000 as proposed by the House and $83,069,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Bill language is included that
specifies amounts by office, consistent with actions in prior
years, and limits transfers among each office to no more than 5
percent. The bill language specifies that any transfer greater
than 5 percent shall be submitted for approval to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations. The following table
summarizes the fiscal year 2003 appropriation for each office:
Immediate office of the Secretary.......................   $2,211,000
Immediate office of the Deputy Secretary................     809,000
Executive Secretariat...................................    1,391,000
Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy............   12,452,000
Office of the General Counsel...........................   15,657,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for budget and
programs............................................    8,375,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for governmental
affairs.............................................    2,453,000
Office of the Assistant Secretary for administration....   29,071,000
Office of public affairs................................    1,926,000
Board of Contract Appeals...............................     611,000
Office of small and disadvantaged business utilization..    1,304,000
Office of the chief information officer.................   13,187,000
Within the amounts provided, the conferees have denied
funding for FECA administrative increases (-$22,000), the
security survey for the new building (-$165,000), and some of
the new increases in the budget for information technology
initiatives not related to security (-$2,800,000).
The conferees direct the office of the secretary to
submit its congressional justification materials in support of
the individual offices of the offices of the secretary at the
same level of detail provided in the congressional
justifications presented in fiscal year 2003.
Bill language, as proposed by both the House and the
Senate, allows the Department to spend up to $60,000 for
official reception and representation activities.
The conference agreement includes bill language that
credits to this appropriation up to $2,500,000 in funds
received in user fees.
Administrative directions.--The conferees direct the
department to submit its annual congressional justifications
for each modal administration to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations on the date on which the
President's budget is delivered officially to Congress.
Office of Intelligence and Security.--The fiscal year
2003 budget did not request any funding for the Office of
Intelligence and Security because it had been transferred to
the Transportation Security Administration, which will be part
of the new Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary may
make arrangements to have one staff detailed to him from this
new Department so that he remains informed on intelligence and
security matters pertaining to transportation. There is
sufficient funding within the salaries and expenses account to
pay for this detailee.
Aviation claims.--The conference agreement includes a
rescission of $90,000,000 from funds enacted to compensate
airlines for losses incurred in the aviation system disruption
in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
The conferees have been assured by the department that the
rescinded funds are unnecessary to meet all of the outstanding
or anticipated claims from air carriers. Such claims include
applications that the department has not processed or that are
involved in litigation. The conferees direct the Secretary to
provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations listing all remaining air carrier claims and all
unprocessed applications for claims and the amounts requested,
the names of air carriers with outstanding claims, and the
steps taken to resolve those outstanding claims; to provide an
anticipated timeline for resolution of outstanding claims and
applications; and to list the remaining uncommitted funds and
balances still available to pay those outstanding claims and
applications.
Report distribution.--The conferees direct the department
to adopt written procedures for report distribution similar to
the standards in place and followed before February 28, 2002.
The House Appropriations Committee has seen serious violations
of the report distribution policy in 2002. In addition, the
conferees direct the department to refrain from attaching
miscellaneous documents, including reports, to Congressional
testimony without prior consultation.
Outstanding reports.--The conference agreement continues
a long standing policy directing the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Budget and Programs to report quarterly on the
status of all outstanding reports and reporting requirements
including how delinquent congressionally mandated or requested
reports are and an estimated date for delivery.
Tier matching based on fiscal capability.--At present,
federal grant programs administered by the Federal Highway
Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Federal
Transit Administration require an identical match of all
communities without regard to their financial circumstances.
Some have asserted that this policy places a disproportionate
burden on lower-income jurisdictions and prevents these
jurisdictions from fully participating in the very programs
necessary to improve conditions. The conferees take no position
on this assertion. However, for the purpose of information
gathering, the conferees separately request the FHWA, FAA, and
FTA to each provide reports covering the programs within each
administration to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations by March 15, 2003 which address this contention.
Should the agencies believe that contention has merit, they may
as part of these reports, propose a tiered matching system for
nonfederal contributions based upon the fiscal capability of
the grantee and which does not increase over the existing grant
programs each program's cumulative financial burden on each
administration.
Alternatively fueled vehicles.--The conferees urge the
Department of Transportation to adhere to the Federal mandates
in the 1992 Energy Policy Act (P.L. 102-486) by purchasing
alternatively fueled vehicles when feasible. The department
should set an example for other government agencies by
purchasing flexible fuel vehicles in order to help lessen our
reliance on foreign oil.
Office of Civil Rights
The conference agreement provides $8,700,000 for the
office of civil rights as proposed by the Senate instead of
$8,500,000 as proposed by the House.
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT
The conference agreement provides $21,000,000 for
transportation planning, research, and development as proposed
by the Senate instead of $11,157,000 as proposed by the House.

following activities:

WestStart's vehicular flywheel project, WA..............   +1,375,000
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
The conference agreement includes a limitation of
$131,766,000 for working capital fund activities instead of a
limitation of $131,766,000 on the transportation administration
service center (TASC) as proposed by the House and a limitation
of $131,779,000 on the TASC as proposed by the Senate. The
Department of Transportation abolished TASC at the end of
calendar year 2002. In its place, DOT re-established a working
capital fund to provide necessary services (e.g., printing,
security, parking, etc.) to all modal entities within the
department.
Modal usage of the working capital fund.--The conferees
direct the department, in its fiscal year 2004 Congressional
justifications for each modal administration, to account for
increases and decreases in working capital fund billings based
on planned usage requested or anticipated by the modes.
MINORITY BUSINESS RESOURCE CENTER PROGRAM
The conference agreement provides an appropriation of
$900,000 for the minority business resource center program and
limits the loans to $18,367,000 as proposed by both the House
and the Senate.
MINORITY BUSINESS OUTREACH
The conference agreement provides a total of $3,000,000
for minority business outreach as proposed by the House and the
Senate.
NEW HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
The conference agreement denies funding for the new DOT
headquarters building as proposed by the Senate. The House
recommended $25,000,000 for tenant build outs related to the
new building.
PAYMENTS TO AIR CARRIERS
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides a total of $113,000,000
for payments to air carriers. Of this total, $52,100,000 is in
direct appropriations; $50,000,000 is to be derived from
overflight user fees and, if necessary, unobligated balances
from the Federal Aviation Administration; and $10,900,000 is to
be derived from carryover balances. The House proposed a total
program level of $113,000,000 for the payments to air carriers
program, of which $50,000,000 was from overflight fees or other
funds available for the Federal Aviation Administration;
$50,000,000 was in direct appropriations; and $13,000,000 was
in carryover balances. The Senate proposed a total program
level of $128,000,000, of which $50,000,000 was from overflight
fees or other funds available for the Federal Aviation
Administration; $65,000,000 was in direct appropriations; and
$13,000,000 was from carryover balances.
TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement recommends $5,180,000,000 for
the Transportation Security Administration instead of
$5,140,000,000 as proposed by the House and $5,346,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Funds are provided in four separate
appropriations, similar to the approach proposed by the House,
instead of a single lump-sum appropriation proposed by the
Senate. The agreement specifies that $144,000,000 of the total
shall be derived by reimbursement from ``Federal Aviation
Administration, Facilities and equipment'' instead of
$176,691,200 proposed by the House and $55,000,000 proposed by
the Senate. Funds are available until expended, as proposed by
the House instead of one year as proposed by the Senate. The
bill includes a provision, proposed by the Senate, allowing any
excess fees collected during fiscal year 2003 to be treated as
offsetting collections during fiscal year 2004.
Staffing cap.--The conferees agree to continue the
limitation on total agency staffing, as proposed by the House.
This prohibits funds to recruit or hire more than 45,000 full-
time permanent staff. The same provision has been in effect
since fiscal year 2002. The agency believed it was critical to
temporarily surge staffing last year, in order to meet the
passenger and baggage screening deadlines in the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act. Now that these deadlines are past,
the conferees believe TSA should focus on eliminating
unnecessary positions, generally through attrition.

--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................  4,516,300,000
Third party screening contracts.--The conference
agreement provides $30,000,000 for third party screening
contracts. Program savings are available due to the existence
of contract recoveries, which the agency estimates will be
available up to $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2003. Thesetwo
sources of funds will provide sufficient resources to meet estimated
contract payments.
Recruiting, assessment, and human resource services
contract.--The conferees encourage the Secretary of
Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, to expeditiously review and, if compliant with Public
Law 85-804 and other statutes, approve any application for
liability protection for the services provided by the
contractor awarded a contract by the Department of
Transportation with an effective date of February 25, 2002 for
recruiting, assessment and human resource services for federal
employees of the Transportation Security Administration.
Credentialing and registered traveler programs.--The
conference agreement includes $35,000,000 for the credentialing
and aviation registered traveler programs. The conferees
support the position of the House that TSA should include
various transportation worker identification card (TWIC)
technologies in the East Coast and West Coast credentialing
pilot projects to result in a fair evaluation of all technology
candidates, including card, reader, and database technologies.
The conferees support TSA's current plan to evaluate the
potential for a central card production, personalization, and
issuance center. The conferees strongly encourage TSA to
consider the benefits of consolidating regional centers into a
centralized location, and the benefits of using existing
government card issuance centers for this activity. The
conferees agree it is essential to include multiple biometrics
on these cards, to verify the identity of the individual
carrying them. The conferees further agree that one card
technology with great capacity for storing biometric
information is the optical lasercard, such as that used by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for permanent resident
cards and by the Department of State for border crossing cards.
The conferees agree that TSA should not develop new
technologies if existing ones, already developed by other
federal agencies, are good enough. While approving funds for
this program and deleting restrictive bill language proposed by
the House, the conferees direct TSA not to obligate funds for
the TWIC prototype phase until the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations are briefed on the results of the technical
evaluation phase and agree that the program should move
forward.
Letters of intent for installation of security systems.--
The bill includes a provision authorizing TSA to sign letters
of intent (LOIs) with airport authorities specifying long-term
funding arrangements for the installation of explosive
detection systems. This process is similar to the existing LOI
process for airport capital improvement projects. While
supportive of this concept, the conferees emphasize that the
signing of such agreements do not obligate or commit the
Federal Government to make future payments until approved by
Congress in the annual budget process. In addition, the
conferees want to ensure that the signing of LOIs do not upset
the proper balance between funding for large, medium, and small
airports. For this reason, the conferees direct TSA not to
commit more than 50 percent of total available funding for
modification of airports to LOIs. This will preserve funding
for smaller airports. A similar restriction has been in place
for many years for LOIs granted under FAA's Airport Improvement
Program.
Use of state and local law enforcement officers.--The
bill includes a provision allowing TSA to utilize the services
of state and local officials as law enforcement officers at
airports, including the authority to deputize such officials as
federal law enforcement officers. The bill specifies that TSA
shall reimburse state and local entities for all reasonable,
allowable, and allocable costs for these services, and
additional funding is provided in the bill to ensure
appropriate payment. In addition, the bill provides that such
officers may provide security services throughout the airport,
and not solely at screening checkpoints, if such action is
preferable for law enforcement purposes.
Fitness for duty requirements.--The conferees are
concerned that the Under Secretary has yet to implement the
fitness for duty requirements stipulated in the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act. As such, the conferees concur in
the initiative of the Senate in providing $250,000 to enable
the Under Secretary to make expedited use of currently
available fitness-for-duty technology to assess saccadic
velocity to determine the potential impairment of airport
security screeners at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
South Terminal Expansion Project, Seattle-Tacoma, WA.--
The Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002
included $225,000,000 over and above the budget request for
airport modifications to accommodate the installation of
explosive detection systems. The statement of managers
accompanying that bill instructed the Under Secretary to be
attentive to the extraordinary needs of certain airports, such
as the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, that are facing
extraordinary costs associated with redesigning airport
terminal projects that are in mid-construction. While the
conferees are pleased that the TSA and the relevant airport
authorities have come to agreement on the total federal
obligation associated with the reconfiguration of the South
Terminal Expansion Project (STEP), the conferees remain
concerned that an agreement has not yet been reached on the
timetable under which these funds will be provided. This bill
provides an additional $265,000,000 for airport modifications,
bringing to just under $500,000,000 the amount of money that
has been provided for airport modifications over and above the
levels sought by the Administration. The conferees urge TSA to
work cooperatively with the Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport to address their unique needs for security-related
airport modifications. The conferees believe that, when
combined with unobligated prior year funds, the funding in this
bill gives TSA sufficient resources to address the long-term
security requirements of airports such as Seattle-Tacoma
International.
MARITIME AND LAND SECURITY
The conference agreement includes $244,800,000 for
maritime and land security. Funds shall be distributed as
follows:
Conference
agreement
Port security grants....................................  $150,000,000
Staff...................................................   21,000,000
Information technology projects.........................    4,800,000
Nuclear detection and monitoring........................    4,000,000
Trucking industry grants................................   25,000,000
Trucking industry grants............................  (20,000,000)

Trucking security pilot program.....................   (1,500,000)
Intercity bus security..................................   10,000,000
Operation Safe Commerce.................................   30,000,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   244,800,000
Trucking industry grants.--Funding provided for trucking
industry grants are to be distributed as follows: $20,000,000
for activities in the budget amendment submitted in September
2002; $3,500,000 for a hazardous materials safety permit
program; and $1,500,000 for a truck security pilot program.
Hazardous materials safety permit program.--The conferees
include $3,500,000 to implement the permit program required by
law for those motor carriers transporting the most dangerous
hazardous materials. Given that this permit program is
especially critical now in light of truck security concerns,
TSA should ensure that it is implemented within one year from
the date of enactment of this Act. The conferees would not
oppose the conduct of this program by FMCSA on a reimbursable
basis.
Truck security pilot program.--The conferees understand
that technology exists from a number of manufacturers that
allows trucks to be remotely tracked and controlled. So that
TSA and FMCSA may completely understand the performance
characteristics of such systems, the conference agreement
includes $1,500,000 for a pilot program.
Nuclear detection and monitoring.--The agreement includes
$4,000,000 to continue evaluation and procurement of portable
nuclear radiation search tools. A similar appropriation was
made in Public Law 107-206. The conferees direct TSA to provide
a status report on this activity to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations not later than March 15, 2003.
Operation Safe Commerce.--The conferees direct that the
$30,000,000 provided in the bill for Operation Safe Commerce
shall be distributed under the same terms and conditions
governing the funding provided for this program for fiscal year
2002.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The conference agreement includes $110,200,000 for
research and development. Funds shall be distributed as
follows:
Conference
agreement
Laboratory space/research facility......................   $5,000,000
Next generation EDS.....................................   75,000,000
Applied R&D.............................................   15,000,000
Staffing................................................    5,200,000
Port security R&D.......................................   10,000,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   110,200,000
Security research.--The conferees do not agree with
language proposed by the Senate specifying that research funds
should be targeted toward detection of chemical, biological or
similar threats. While the conferees agree that such research
is a high priority for funding, the Under Secretary for
Transportation Security has the flexibility to establish
overall agency priorities in security research.
Port security research and development.--The conference
agreement includes $10,000,000 for port security research and
development activities at national laboratories, private non-
profit organizations, institutions of higher education, and
other entities. The conferees direct that, should any of these
funds be allocated to a Department of Energy laboratory, they
shall be administered. This policy is consistent with section
309 of The Homeland Security Act of 2002.
ADMINISTRATION
The conference agreement includes $308,700,000 for
administration. Funds shall be distributed as follows:
Conference

COAST GUARD
OPERATING EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $4,322,122,000 for
operating expenses of the Coast Guard, instead of
$4,305,456,000 as proposed by the House and $4,318,456,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Of the total amount provided,
$340,000,000 is for defense-related activities, as proposed by
the Senate, instead of $1,300,000,000 as proposed by the House.
The following table summarizes the House and Senate's

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small boat station and command center readiness.--The
bill includes language specifying that not less than
$15,686,000 of additional funding shall be used to address
readiness problems at the nation's small boat stations and
associated command centers. This is the second year of a
multiyear effort to restore the readiness level of these
critical facilities. The conferees direct the Coast Guard to
submit a five year operating and capital plan to address the
readiness problems, including elements which appropriately
allocate billets to cover on-board and planned staffing levels.
The conferees request the U.S. General Accounting Office to
review and certify that the additional funding provided in this
bill is being used to supplement, and not supplant, the level
of effort in fiscal year 2002.
Limitation on flag officers.--The bill includes the
limitation, proposed by the Senate, prohibiting the hire of
more than 37 active duty flag officers during fiscal year 2003.
Pier safety study.--As proposed by the House, the
conferees direct the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Army
Corps of Engineers, to conduct a study of pier safety, to be
submitted within six months of enactment of this Act.
Oil spill prevention, 13th District.--The conference
agreement includes $1,600,000 for additional oil spill
prevention activities in the Coast Guard 13th District, as
proposed by the Senate. The Coast Guard is expected to consult
fully with the Captain of the Port, Puget Sound, in making
determinations on the scope and use of these funds.
Great Lakes pilotage.--The conferees understand that the
Coast Guard has before it a proposal to change the pilotage
system on the Great Lakes. The conferees urge the Coast Guard
to ensure that this proposal receives all due consideration,
including public comment as appropriate and full review by the
Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Committee.
Polar icebreaking reimbursement.--The conferees agree to
a reduction of $2,500,000 assuming higher reimbursements for
polar icebreaking activities, instead of $3,149,000 as proposed
by the House. The conferees agree that the entire reduction is
to be taken from costs related to activities in the Antarctic
region.
ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS
The conference agreement includes $742,100,000 for
acquisition, construction, and improvements instead of
$725,000,000 as proposed by the House and $752,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The agreement includes certain
restrictions on the Integrated Deepwater Systems program, as
proposed by the House and Senate. Consistent with past years
and the House and Senate bills, the conference agreement
distributes funds by budget activity. Further, the bill
includes a contingent rescission relating to submission of the
Capital Investment Plan to the Congress, as proposed by the
Senate.
A table showing the distribution of this appropriation by
project, as included in the fiscal year 2003 budget estimate,
House bill, Senate bill, and the conference agreement is as

LTS-101 engine.--The conference agreement includes
$4,000,000 to enhance the reliability of the HH-65 LTS-101
engine through the incorporation of FADEC system technology.
The conferees continue to support continued evaluation of the
Ariel engine by the Coast Guard, and do not intend that these
funds undermine support or progress in that effort.
Integrated deepwater systems.--The conference agreement
includes $478,000,000 for the integrated deepwater systems

Maritime patrol aircraft.--Although the Coast Guard's
budget request for the IDS program assumed the acquisition of 2
maritime patrol aircraft in fiscal year 2003, recently the
service announced a restructure of its funding plan which
defers that acquisition. The conferees are surprised that,
after a detailed planning phase lasting several years, the
service's operational requirements and asset replacement plans
could be so radically changed this early in the IDS contract.
The conferees are not yet convinced that this change is in the
best interest of the Coast Guard, and provide funding for these
assets in line with the original budget request. Before the
Coast Guard effectuates a change of this nature, the service is
required to seek Congressional approval through the
reprogramming process.
IDS reprogramming procedures.--The conferees agree with
reprogramming guidelines as proposed by the House except that
programs, projects, and activities with a baseline of
$5,000,000 or less may execute below threshold reprogrammings
not to exceed 20 percent of the baseline amount. The baseline
for all other PPAs shall be 10 percent. The distribution of
funds table shown above shall serve as the reprogramming
baseline for this program in fiscal year 2003.
IDS compliance with the Buy American Act.--The bill
includes a provision, as proposed by the House, clarifying that
the IDS procurement program is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Buy American Act. The conferees do not seek
to amend that Act to apply content standards to individual
components of vessels. By letter to the House Committee on
Appropriations dated October 1, 2002, the Assistant Commandant
for Acquisition stated that this language is considered by the
service to be ``a restatement of [the Coast Guard's]
obligations under existing law and not as an imposition of any
additional legal requirements''.
Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements
(RESCISSION)
The conference agreement includes a rescission of
unobligated balances from ``Acquisition, construction, and
improvements'' of $17,000,000. The Secretary is directed to
advise the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the
distribution of this rescission prior to its implementation.
Environmental Compliance and Restoration
The conference agreement includes $17,000,000 for
environmental compliance and restoration, as proposed by both
the House and Senate.
Alteration of Bridges
The conference agreement includes $17,200,000 for
alteration of bridges deemed hazardous to marine navigation,
instead of $17,000,000 proposed by the House and $14,000,000
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement distributes
these funds as follows:
Bridge and location                    Amount
New Orleans, LA, Florida Ave RR/HW Bridge...............   $3,500,000
Brunswick, GA, Sidney Lanier HW Bridge..................    2,500,000

--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   17,200,000
Retired Pay
The conference agreement includes $889,000,000 for
retired pay, as proposed by both the House and Senate.
Reserve Training
The conference agreement includes $86,495,000 for reserve
training.
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation
The conference agreement includes $22,000,000 for
research, development, test, and evaluation as proposed by the
Senate instead of $21,000,000 as proposed by the House. The
conferees agree that, within the funds provided, $1,000,000 is
for continued development, demonstration, and evaluation of
engineered wood composites at Coast Guard facilities, including
stations in Jonesport and Southwest Harbor, Maine, as proposed
by the House, instead of $3,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Further, within the funds provided, $1,000,000 is for a pilot
project to test automatic search and rescue spectral imaging
technology for Coast Guard C-130 aircraft, instead of
$2,500,000 proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement
includes $250,000 for a prototype observation system in the
Lower Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, and $250,000 for research at
the Coast Guard Fire Safety Test Detachment in Alabama, as
proposed by the Senate.
Federal Aviation Administration
OPERATIONS
The conference agreement includes $7,069,019,000 for
operations of the Federal Aviation Administration, instead of
$7,060,203,000 proposed by the House and $7,047,203,000
proposed by the Senate. Of the total amount provided,
$3,799,278,000 (53.7 percent) is to be derived from the airport
and airway trust fund, as proposed by the Senate. Funds are
distributed in the bill by budget activity, as proposed by the
Senate. The bill maintains a prohibition on funds for
aeronautical charting and cartography activities conducted by,
or coordinated through, the Working Capital Fund, as proposed
by the House.
The following table compares the conference agreement to
the levels proposed in the House and Senate bills by budget
activity:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administration of potential shortfall due to essential
air service transfer.--The conferees agree that the FAA
Administrator has the flexibility to propose the use of funds
in either the ``Operations'' or ``Facilities and equipment''
appropriations to address any shortfalls in essential air
service funding for which FAA resources are required under
existing law. The Administrator is directed to advise the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the appropriations
and programs from which these funds would be drawn.
Air traffic staffing budget.--The conferees agree that
the report proposed by the House on allocation of the air
traffic staffing shortfall is to be submitted to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than 30 days after
enactment of this Act.
National Park air tour management plans.--In reducing
this program by $4,100,000, the conferees do not intend to slow
down the review and approval of air tour management plans. The
reduction reflects a substantial delay in this program due to
schedule slippage in issuance of the final rule.
Drug/alcohol compliance testing.--In agreeing to the
House's proposed reduction to this activity, the conferees do
not intend to diminish the agency's level of effort in employee
drug and alcohol testing. However, the agency has not yet
demonstrated a link between identified problems in
administration of this program and the need for additional
resources. The conferees believe the identified problems can
largely be addressed without additional resources at this time.
Contract tower program.--The conference agreement
includes $78,000,000 to fund the baseline contract tower
program and $6,000,000 for the contract tower cost-sharing
program. Consistent with current law and existing lease
arrangements, the conferees direct FAA to continue reimbursing
airports for space the agency utilizes at all contract tower
locations previously staffed by the agency, including existing,
newly constructed, and future replacement towers. The conferees
commend those airports that are moving forward with replacing
outdated towers. The conferees do not believe smaller airports
should be compelled to provide FAA free space in replacement
contract towers.
Facilities and Equipment
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement includes $2,981,022,000 for
``Facilities and equipment'', as proposed by both the House and
Senate. Of the total amount available, $404,655,240 is
available for one year, and $2,576,366,760 is available for
three years. The bill deletes a provision proposed by the
Senate that would have provided a contingent rescission
relating to submission of the FY 2004 Capital Investment Plan.
This provision is no longer necessary, as the report has been
submitted to the Congress.
The following table provides a breakdown of the House and
Senate bills and the conference agreement by program:

Small Community Air Service Development
The conference agreement deletes the separate
appropriation for this program proposed by the House. Instead,
this program is funded under ``Grants-in-aid for airports'' at
the level proposed by both the House and Senate.
FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION
Limitation on Administrative Expenses
The conference agreement limits administrative expenses
of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to $316,126,000,
instead of $370,042,000 as proposed by the House and
$317,732,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement provides that certain sums be
made available under section 104(a)(1)(A) of title 23, U.S.C.
to carry out specified activities as follows: $7,500,000 shall
be available for child passenger protection education grants as
authorized under section 2003(b) of Public Law 105-178, as
amended; $47,000,000 shall be available for border safety
inspection facilities at the Southern border; $59,967,000 shall
be available for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration's border enforcement activities; $269,700,000
shall be available for surface transportation projects; and
$7,000,000 shall be available for environmental streamlining.
The conferees recommend the following adjustments to the
budget request by program and activity:
Employee development (including FECA administrative
costs)..............................................   -$1,606,000
FHWA streamlining.--The conferees direct the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) to provide the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations a report, not later than April 15,
2003, summarizing FHWA's streamlining efforts, as proposed by
the House. The report should include specific examples of FHWA
activities that help streamline the environmental process.
Federal-Aid Highways
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement limits obligations for the
federal-aid highways program to $31,800,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate, instead of $27,653,143,000 as proposed by the
House.
Performance based outcomes.--The conferees recognize the
positive impact that performance based outcomes have on the
road building industry by allowing contractors the freedom and
flexibility to focus on quality long term performance and
encourage the Department of Transportation to continue to
explore their use.
Broughton Bridge improvements.--A total of $1,850,000 was
provided to make improvements to Broughton Bridge, Kansas, in
Public Laws 106-346 and 107-87. The conferees direct that the
balance shall be available to make improvements to the access
road to the bridge, including pavement overlay and related
shoulder work.
Middle East-West Highway.--Of the funds provided for
Middle East-West Highway, Maine, not less than $1,000,000 shall
be used to study a potential East-West corridor in Maine and
other ferry terminal facilities, as proposed by the Senate.
Large Project Management and Oversight.--As evidenced by
the high profile difficulties that have plagued the Central
Artery, Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and Springfield Interchange
projects--including dramatic cost increases and significant
schedule delays--the need for improvement of FHWA's financial
oversight and accountability on large projects cannot be
overemphasized. Although the FHWA has made notable progress in
converting these difficulties into constructive catalysts for
change, the conferees remain concerned about project
management. The Inspector General has noted that FHWA's
traditional engineering focus has inhibited the effective
scrutiny of other major project drivers such as financing, cost
controls, and schedule performance. To successfully refocus on
the evaluation of each state's processes for managing and
overseeing projects, the FHWA will need to evaluate the range
of disciplines and skills within its staff. Specifically, the
conferees direct the FHWA to develop a strategy for achieving a
more multidisciplinary approach towards its oversight
activities, to include: identification of staff with private
sector management skills, such as financing and cost
estimation; streamlining and delegation of project-level
approvals to facilitate greater emphasis upon oversight of
higher-level management and financial issues; and
implementation of a planned data collection system for trend
analysis. The conferees further direct FHWA to deliver this
strategy no later than May 15, 2003.
Ambassador Bridge.--The conferees continue language
directing the FHWA to ensure that funds provided for the
Ambassador Bridge/Gateway Project in Public Law 105-178 are
used only for that project.
Rural Road Safety.--The conference agreement retains
language pertaining to rural road safety, requiring GAO to
review federal funding of rural road safety improvements and to
determine whether some interstate design characteristics could
improve rural road safety. The report is to be submitted one
year from the date of enactment of this Act.
Interstate 49 South, Louisiana.--The conferees have been
informed of the decision of FHWA to sign a record of decision
on the alignment of Interstate 49 south of Interstate 10. House
Report 107-722 clearly directs the agency to evaluate
alternative routes to this project, including the Teche Ridge
route. The conferees direct FHWA to conduct a study of the
feasibility of a supplemental roadway to evacuate motorists in
the event of a natural disaster, which shall include the Teche
Ridge route and other routes or corridors. The conferees agree
that the review shall not prevent progress or delay the
completion of this project.
Costa Mesa, California, Susan Street Project.--Regarding
the Costa Mesa, California, Susan Street Project, the Director
and the District 12 Director of the California State Department
of Transportation are directed to certify to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations and the Secretary of the
United States Department of Transportation within 90 days of
enactment of this Act that all State operational and safety
requirements have been met with regard to the execution of the
New Harbor Boulevard North Off-Ramp project along the Route 405
Distributor Road in Costa Mesa, California. The Director of the
California State Department of Transportation, after making
such certification, may then approve the access point of the
proposed off-ramp from the Interstate System in accordance with
applicable State law and procedures.
Pennsylvania Avenue.--The conferees have included
$6,100,000 for planning and design activities and for the
initiation of construction of the improvement project at
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. Of the funds
provided, $2,800,000 is to complete the planning and design for
the project and $3,300,000 is for conducting structural testing
of streetscape components, initial surveying and utility
relocation. In addition, $5,000,000 is provided for
transportation studies to address traffic problems in the
immediate vicinity of the White House, including an engineering
design to alleviate congestion resulting from street closures
in that area. The project is to be managed by the FHWA in
consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission.
The Federal Highway Administration shall submit a report
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and the
Office of Management and Budget within 6 months of enactment of
this Act on the Pennsylvania Avenue enhancements, as well as
the study that examines the impacts of street closures and
traffic restrictions in the vicinity of the White House.
Limitation on Transportation Research
The conferees provide a general limitation on
transportation research of $462,500,000, as proposed by both
the House and the Senate.
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH
Within the funds provided for surface transportation
research, the conference agreement includes $103,000,000 for
highway research and development for the following activities:

State University for the Southern Rural Transportation Center;
$400,000 to the Orangeburg County Rural Transit Demonstration
project at South Carolina State University; and $1,200,000 to
analyze existing conditions and make recommendations that will
enhance the freight mobility transportation system in
Washington State.
The conference agreement does not provide funds for
statistical analysis of the National Quality Initiative under
any FHWA research program, as proposed by the House. Such
analysis shall be performed by the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics.
Pavements.--The conference agreement provides $15,500,000
for pavements research. Within the funds provided for this
activity, the conferees encourage FHWA to provide: $1,000,000
to the Center for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement Technology
at Iowa State University; $500,000 to support the Institute for
Aggregate Research at Michigan Technological University;
$750,000 to continue evaluation of GSB-88 emulsified binder

Pavement Testing. FHWA is currently conducting research
to study, select, build, and test up to twelve lanes of newly
constructed asphalt pavement. The conferees are concerned that
the current Superpave system does not effectively characterize
the performance of modified asphalt binders. Therefore, the
conferees direct FHWA to add unmodified binders to the
Accelerated Load Frame (``ALF'') tests that are currently being
undertaken, specifically the Full-Scale Accelerated Performance
Testing for Superpave and Structural Validation testing being
performed at the Turner Fairbanks Highway Research Facility.
Unmodified asphalt binders shall be tested to serve as a
comparison to the modified asphalt binders. FHWA shall also
measure emissions during application and report the findings as
a part of this study.
INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
The conference agreement provides a limitation on
Intelligent Transportation Systems of $232,000,000, as proposed
by the Senate. Of the total, $110,000,000 is for intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) research and development, as
proposed by the Senate, for the following activities:
Research and development................................   $50,701,000
Operational tests.......................................   10,782,000
Evaluations.............................................    6,739,000
Architecture and standards..............................   18,686,000
Integrations............................................   11,455,000
Program support.........................................   11,455,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   110,000,000
Research.--The conference agreement provides $50,701,000
for research and development. Within the funds provided for
this activity, the conferees encourage FHWA to provide
$6,800,000 for commercial vehicle research.
Joint Program Office.--In the early 1990s, the
Appropriations Committees expressed strong support for the
formulation of a Joint Program Office (JPO) within the DOT to
oversee the federal role in the National Intelligent
Transportation system (ITS) effort. This office, which is
located within the Federal Highway Administration, now provides
overall program direction and budget coordination among the
multiple DOT offices conducting ITS activities. The success of
the federal investment in ITS has been due partly to the
effective functioning of the JPO. For example, the JPO's close
association with FHWA's research, headquarters staff, and
regional offices has ensured a unified approach to providing
training, implementing and testing standards, and adhering to a
national systems architecture. The conferees maintain that the
JPO's positive working relationship with the FMCSA and FTA has
facilitated progress in advancement of technologies and the
deployment of activities.
The appropriation for ITS provided by the conferees is
predicated on the continuation of the JPO conducting the
functions identified previously. Maximum efficiencies are most
likely to be obtained by retaining the current administrative
structure of the JPO within the FHWA with a reporting function
to the Deputy Secretary. If there is any change in the
administrative structure or responsibilities of the JPO, the
Secretary is directed to inform the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations and to justify in detail such changes.
Intelligent transportation systems deployment projects.--
Within the funds available for intelligent transportation
systems deployment, the conference agreement provides that not
lessthan the following sums shall be available for intelligent
transportation projects in these specified areas:

Bureau of Transportation Statistics
The conferees provide $31,000,000 for the Bureau of
Transportation Statistics. Under the FHWA appropriations, the
accompanying bill provides $31,000,000 for the Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS), the amount authorized in TEA-
21. The conferees note that BTS has undergone significant
increases in staffing since 1993, the year BTS was established.
In fiscal year 1993, on-board positions totaled 5; in 2001,
total staff stood at 101; and BTS estimates on-board staff to
total 146 by the end of 2002. In fiscal year 2003, BTS requests
a level of 157 full-time positions (FTP). The conferees are
very concerned about these staff increases, particularly when
the staffing level has exceeded the Administration's request to
Congress. Therefore, the conference committee directs BTS to
fill no more than 146 full-time positions, or if lower, the
number of on-board positions upon enactment of this Act.

$250,000,000 of contract authority balances from the five core
programs are rescinded. These resources can not be obligated by
the states as they were apportioned at levels over and above
annual statutory obligation limitations. The conferees direct
FHWA not to rescind the authority on a proportional basis by
program and instead to administer the rescission by allowing
each state maximum flexibility among the five programs in
making these adjustments.
FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
Motor Carrier Safety
Limitation on Administrative Expenses
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement includes $117,464,000 for
administrative expenses of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration under the FMCSA limitation on administrative
expenses account, as proposed by the Senate. Of the funds
provided, $110,464,000 is for operating expenses and $7,000,000
is for research and technology initiatives. The following
adjustments are made to the budget request:
FECA administrative costs...............................    -$20,000
Hazardous materials safety and security.................    +500,000
Share the road safely...................................    -100,000
Safety is good business program.........................    -250,000
Research and technology information dissemination.......    -150,000
Undistributed reduction.................................    -500,000
FECA administrative costs.--The conference agreement
denies $20,000 for FECA administrative costs, as proposed by
the House.
Share the road program.--Statistics for 1999 show that 78
percent of all fatal truck crashes are collisions between large
trucks and other vehicles. Data from 1998 indicate that
approximately 81 percent of all large truck and other vehicle
fatal crashes are the result of action initiated by passenger
vehicle drivers. The conferees believe that the share the road
program needs to be retargeted and broader than its main
campaign that focused on warning noncommercial drivers to avoid
truck blind spots. The conferees provide $100,000 for FMCSA's
share the road program and encourage the agency to coordinate
its share the road efforts with NHTSA, as proposed by the
Senate. Further, the conferees direct the General Accounting
Office to evaluate the effectiveness of the share the road
program, make recommendations to strengthen the program, and
submit the study to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations by July 15, 2003, as proposed by the House.
Commercial drivers license program.-- The conference
agreement retains language recommending that more work needs to
be done to address deficiencies in the CDL program. As proposed
by the House, within the funds provided for the CDL program,
FMCSA should continue working with the American Association of
Motor Vehicle Administrators, the Commercial Vehicle Safety
Alliance, lead MCSAP agencies and licensing agencies to improve
all aspects of the CDL program. In addition, FMCSA should
consider sponsoring another pilot project involving law
enforcement and driver licensing agencies to explore new and
innovative ways to ensure that drivers who have been convicted
of a disqualifying offense do not operate during the period of
suspension or revocation. Finally, FMCSA should continue to
support the judicial and prosecutorial outreach effort.
Furthermore, as proposed by the Senate, the conferees
encourage FMCSA to adopt a CDL-related standard that includes
monitoring, consistent with OIG recommendations in the menu of
oversight activities for state and third-party CDL examiners.
Untethered truck trailer tracking and security.--The
conference agreement has provided $2,000,000 to leverage
existing technology and develop an untethered trailer tracking
and control system that will provide real-time trailer
identification, location, geofensing, unscheduled movement
notification, door sensors, and alarms, as proposed by the
House.
Solid waste shippers.--The conferees direct the FMCSA to
work with the Commonwealth of Virginia's MCSAP agency to
conduct 3 one-day concentrated roadside inspection strike
forces on interstate waste haulers. The results shall be
compiled in a letter submitted to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations by September 31, 2003.
Crash causation study.--The conference agreement includes
language proposed by the Senate urging FMCSA to make available
the preliminary results of the crash causation study as soon as
a representative data set is analyzed and to submit a letter to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by May 15,
2003, indicating the study's progress, the response to and
status of the Transportation Research Board's recommendations,
and a time schedule for the release of the initial results. In
addition, the conferees direct NHTSA to request that the
Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control evaluate the adequacy of the crash
causation research design. CDC's evaluation is to be provided
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
Hazardous materials transportation.--The conference
agreement includes an additional $500,000 above the budget
request for hazardous materials safety and security, as
proposed by both the House and the Senate. The conferees urge
FMCSA to enforce compliance with Federal hazardous materials
regulations and to encourage states to use the motor carrier
safety assistance program for hazardous materials safety and
security research. In addition, the conferees recommend that
FMCSA develop innovative strategies to minimize the risks of
transporting hazardous materials.
``Safety is Good Business'' Program.--The conferees have
deleted funding for the Safety is Good Business program from
the Motor Carrier Safety Account, as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees believe that this funding should come from
FMCSA's high priority initiative program within the Motor
Carrier Safety Assistance Program.
Younger driver pilot program.--The conference agreement
includes language as proposed by the Senate directing the FMCSA
administrator to conduct an analysis of the safety
ramifications associated with the younger driver pilot program.
The conferees include a provision, as proposed by the House,
prohibiting the DOT from implementing a pilot program allowing
commercial drivers 18 to 20 years of age to operate commercial
motor vehicles in interstate commerce. This provision does not
prohibit FMCSA from studying the younger driver pilot program;
the prohibition only applies to the development or
implementation of such a program.
Driver record improvements.--The conferees include
language as proposed by the Senate regarding improvements to
the issuance or renewal of a motor vehicle operator's license.
The conferees direct NHTSA and FMCSA to conduct an analysis of
the costs associated with the development of the one driver,
one record pointer system and the steps necessary for
implementation, and to report its findings to the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations by August 1, 2003.
Driver research.--Within the funds provided for research
and technology, the conference agreement provides $700,000 for
the Transportation Research Institute at the George Washington
University Virginia campus, as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees also provide $250,000 to initiate a separate
multidisciplinary driver research program, as proposed by the
Senate.
National Motor Carrier Safety Program
(Liquidation of Contract Authorization)
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides a liquidating cash
appropriation of $190,000,000 for the national motor carrier
safety program as proposed by the House and the Senate.
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
The conference agreement includes a limitation on
obligations of $190,000,000 for motor carrier safety grants as
proposed by the House and the Senate.
Truck driver training program.--Within the funds provided
for FMCSA's high priority initiative program, the conference
agreement provides $700,000 for the development of a concrete
skid pad at Lewis-Clark State College North Lewiston Training
Facility.
Highway watch program.--The Senate proposed funding
$1,000,000 for the continuation of the Highway Watch program.
The conference agreement denies this funding.
Operation respond.--Also within funds provided for
FMCSA's high priority initiative program, the conference
agreement provides $1,000,000 to design, build and demonstrate
the benefits of a hazardous materials incident detection,
management, and response system, including the expansion of the
Operation Respond network. The conferees urge that these funds
be used to establish a national first responders emergency
services network and to accelerate deployment of Operation
Respond software.
Border Enforcement Program
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides a total of $59,967,000
for the Border Enforcement program under the Federal Highway
Administration's 104(a)(1)(A) administrative takedown, as
proposed by the Senate. Within this amount, the conferees
provide $41,967,000 for Federal border enforcement staffing and
operations and $18,000,000 for state operations grants to the
southern border states, as proposed by both the House and the
Senate.
U.S. Southern border.--The conference agreement extends a
provision from the fiscal year 2002 appropriations Act
regarding the safety of cross-border trucking between the
United States and Mexico. Further, the conferees direct the
Secretary to report annually on the safety and security of the
U.S. Southern border with regard to motor carrier
transportation into the U.S. by Mexican-domiciled motor
carriers.
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
Operations and Research
The conference agreement provides $138,288,000 from the
general fund for highway and traffic safety activities instead
of $131,433,000 as proposed by the House and $141,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate. A total of $98,161,131 shall remain
available until September 30, 2005 as proposed by the House and
the Senate.
The agreement includes a provision carried since fiscal
year 1996 that prohibits NHTSA from obligating or expending
funds to plan, finalize, or implement any rulemakings that
would add requirements pertaining to tire grading standards
that are not related to safety performance. This provision was
contained in both the House and Senate bills.
Operations and Research
(Liquidation of Contract Authorization)
(Limitation on Obligations)
(Highway Trust Fund)
The conference agreement provides $72,000,000 from the
highway trust fund to carry out provisions of 23 U.S.C. 403 as
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
The following table summarizes the conference agreement
for operations and research (general fund and highway trust
fund combined) by budget activity:
Salaries and benefits...................................   $63,316,000
Travel..................................................    1,324,000
Operating expenses......................................   22,834,000
Contract programs:
Safety performance..................................   10,393,000
Safety assurance....................................   15,760,000
Highway safety programs.............................   48,463,000
Research and analysis...............................   60,691,000
General administration..............................     657,000
Grant administration reimbursements.....................   -11,150,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................  $212,288,000
FECA administrative costs.--The conference agreement
deletes $12,000 proposed in the budget for FECA administrative
costs. This action is consistent across all modal
administrations.
Workforce planning and development activities.--The
conference agreement provides a total of $300,000 for workforce
planning and development activities as proposed by the Senate
in its explanatory language delineated in the Congressional
Record of January 15, 2003. This is a reduction of $115,000
from the budget request.
Contracting procedures.--The conferees urge NHTSA to
review its contracting procedures and take appropriate steps to
eliminate unnecessary delays. Too often, contract recipients
have had to wait for several months before Federal funds are
granted after a contract is awarded.
National occupant protection program.--The conference
agreement provides $3,000,000 above the budget request to
bolster the national occupant protection program. The
additional funds shall be used to continue outreach activities
to increase seat belt use by minority populations, teens, and
rural populations.
Passenger vehicle tire traction.--The conferees encourage
NHTSA to include standards for tire performance on wet road
surfaces when the agency prepares its final rule on tire safety
performance, as discussed in the Senate's explanatory
statement. Absent such inclusion, NHTSA shall send a letter to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations explaining
why wet road tire performance standards were not included.
Ejection prevention measures.--NHTSA has identified both
occupant ejection and upgraded roof crush resistance as ``near
term'' regulatory priorities that the agency plans to undertake
in 2003. Consistent with this proposal, the conferees support
the adoption of measures to improve ejection prevention
performance of motor vehicles no later than December 31, 2004,
and recognize that the agency may need to develop new test
procedures.
Early warning reporting system.--The conferees direct
NHTSA to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations detailing the methods the agency will adopt to
ensure that all tires imported and sold in the United States
comply with the early warning report system, as outlined in
NHTSA's final regulations. This report should be issued by July
1, 2003.
Defects information system.--The Inspector General raised
concerns about whether the new defects information system can
be successfully implemented on time and within the estimated
$5,000,000 budget. Since the issuance of this report, NHTSA has
concurred with the IG's concerns. The conferees direct NHTSA to
provide a letter to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations that details the current schedule and cost
estimate for this system, explain any cost increases, and
indicate how these new costs will be paid for.
Impaired driving.--The conference agreement provides
$4,000,000 above the budget request for the impaired driving
program. Of this total: $1,000,000 shall be used for judicial
and prosecutorial initiatives; $2,000,000 shall be used on the
repeat offender tracking model; and $1,000,000 shall be used on
target population outreach efforts.
Within the funding provided for judicial and
prosecutorial outreach, NHTSA, in conjunction with the Attorney
General, should identify and report on the best strategies for
reducing obstacles to obtaining impaired driving convictions
and strategies to help prosecutors and judges apply sanctions
in a consistent manner. The report should also emphasize
strategies to reduce plea bargaining, diversion, or deferral
programs, and other means used by offenders to avoid any
permanent record. This report must be submitted to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations by October 1, 2003.
NHTSA shall detail to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations, in letter format, the concept behind the repeat
offender tracking model, the total cost to develop the model,
the anticipated yearly costs to enact the model, and the
schedule to develop and enact this program. NHTSA should
develop this model with input from the states and the highway
safety community.
As part of the impaired driving program, the conferees
suggest that NHTSA evaluate point of sales training as proposed
by the House.
Alcohol ignition interlock devices.--The conferees have
not provided any funding for research to advance the alcohol
ignition interlock devices proposed by the Senate.
Drugs, driving and youth.--The conference agreement funds
the drugs, driving and youth program at the 2003 budget request
as proposed by the House.
Motorcycles.--A total of $945,000 has been provided for
motorcycle programs, an increase of $300,000 above the budget
request. This additional funding shall be used for strategies
to enhance motorcycle rider's crash avoidance skills and
improve conspicuity. In addition, as directed by the House,
$500,000 shall be used for demonstration projects related to
motorcycle training.
Crash causation study.--The conferees have included
$2,000,000 to update a 23-year-old crash causation study, as
proposed by the House.
Highway safety data and traffic records.--The conference
agreement does not provide funding for NHTSA to continue
working with the states to improve highway safety data and
traffic records, similar to activities funded previously under
the section 411 grant program. The conferees understand the
agency has carryover funding available for these efforts from
other grant programs, such as section 410.
Emergency medical services head injury research.--A total
of $2,189,000 has been provided for emergency medical services.
Of this amount, $750,000 shall be used to continue training
emergency medical service personnel in delivering prehospital
care to patients with traumatic brain injuries.
Biomechanics.--The conference agreement provides a total
of $14,950,000 for biomechanics research, $1,000,000 more than
the budget request, to continue research of the CIREN program.
Also, within the funds provided, $2,000,000 shall be used to
continue research related to traumatic brain and spinal cord
injuries at the Southern Consortium for Injury Biomechanics.
National Automotive Sampling System.--The conference
agreement has provided $795,000 above the budget request so
that NHTSA can expand the National Automotive Sampling System
database with a particular focus on child safety seat and tire-
related data, as proposed by the Senate.
Built-in child booster systems.--The conference agreement
does not include funding, proposed by the Senate, to study the
effectiveness of built-in child booster systems with other
systems. The built-in technology is not advanced enough to
warrant a study at this time.
Heavy vehicle research.--Within the funds provided for
heavy vehicle research, $500,000 is for the National
Transportation Research Center in Tennessee to continue to
conduct broad-based laboratory-to-roadside research in heavy
vehicle safety issues.
Pneumatic tire research.--The conference agreement
includes $375,000 in the pneumatic tire program for Mercer
Engineering Research Center, as proposed in the Senate's
explanatory statement of January 15, 2003.
National Driver Register
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides $2,000,000 for the
National Driver Register as proposed by both the House and the
Senate.
Highway Traffic Safety Grants
(LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides $225,000,000 to
liquidate contract authorizations for highway traffic safety
grants, as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Highway Traffic Safety Grants
(LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS)
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement limits obligations for highway
traffic safety grants to $225,000,000 as proposed by both the
House and the Senate. The bill includes separate obligation
limitations with the following funding allocations:
Highway safety programs.................................  $165,000,000
Occupant protection incentive grants....................   $20,000,000
Alcohol incentive grants................................   $40,000,000
A total of $11,150,000 has been provided for
administration of the grant programs as proposed by both the
House and the Senate. Of this total, not more than $8,150,000
of the funds made available for section 402; not more than
$1,000,000 of the funds made available for section 405; and not
more than $2,000,000 of the funds made available for section
410 shall be available to NHTSA for administering highway
safety grants under chapter 4 of title 23. This language is
necessary to ensure that each grant program does not contribute
more than five percent of the total administrative costs.
The conference agreement retains bill language, proposed
by both the House and Senate, that limits technical assistance
to states from section 410 to $500,000.
The conference agreement prohibits the use of funds for
construction, rehabilitation or remodeling costs, or for office
furnishings and fixtures for state, local, or private buildings
or structures, as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION
Safety and Operations
The conference agreement provides $117,363,000 for safety
and operations as proposed by the House instead of $118,264,000
as proposed by the Senate. Within this total, the conferees
have funded four new positions. The conference agreement
includes language that permits $6,636,000 of the total funding
to remain available until expended as proposed by both the
House and the Senate.
FECA administrative costs.--The conference agreement
deletes $65,000 proposed in the budget for FECA administrative
costs. This action is consistent across all modal
administrations.
Study on grade crossings.--As directed by the Senate in
its explanatory statement in the Congressional Record of
January 15, 2003, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit
with the fiscal year 2005 budget request an action plan
outlining specific efforts to be pursued by FRA, FHWA, FMCSA,
NHTSA, and the ITS Joint Program Office to improve safety at
both public and private grade crossings.
Positive train control.--The conferees direct FRA to
submit an updated economic analysis of the costs and benefits
of positive train control and related systems that takes into
account advances in technology and system savings to carriers
and shippers as well as other cost savings related to
prioritized deployment of these systems, as proposed by the
Senate. This analysis must be submitted as a letter report to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by October 1,
2003.
Safety assurance and compliance program (SACP).--By April
1, 2003, FRA must provide a status report on the utilization of
the safety assurance and compliance program, which summarizes
the SACP activities in fiscal year 2002 and the agency's audit
plans for fiscal year 2003 as proposed by the Senate.
Railroad threat assessment.--The conferees are concerned
over the targeting of railroad facilities, structures,
terminals and operations posed by terrorist entities and urge
the FRA to work with the new Department of Homeland Security
and the Association of American Railroads to develop a
comprehensive assessment of the threats and vulnerabilities
nationwide, and identify ways to enhance passenger safety and
infrastructure protection.
Railroad Research and Development
The conference agreement provides $29,325,000 for
railroad research and development as proposed by the Senate
instead of $27,325,000 as proposed by the House. None of this
funding is to be offset from user fees.
Integrated railway remote information service.--The
conference agreement does not provide any funding for the
integrated railway remote information service proposed by the
Senate. Last year funding was provided for this program;
however, FRA was directed to evaluate this initiative before
additional funding was provided. To date, no evaluation has
been conducted.
Marshall University/University of Nebraska.--The
conference agreement includes $1,400,000 to support Marshall
University and the University of Nebraska to conduct safety
studies in any of the following areas: track and structures,
human factors, equipment, train control, grade crossing and
digital communications.
Transportation Technology Center.--The conference
agreement provides a total of $675,000 for site improvements at
the Transportation Technology Center, as proposed by the House.
Freight congestion study.--The conferees direct FRA to
work with the Chicago Transportation Coordination Office and
communities in the Chicago region consistent with the Senate's
explanatory statement of January 15, 2003. Reports must be
submitted quarterly to the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations.
Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Program
The conference agreement includes a provision, proposed
by both the House and the Senate, specifying that no new direct
loans or loan guarantee commitments shall be made using federal
funds for the payment of any credit premium amounts during
fiscal year 2003. No federal appropriation is required since a
non-federal infrastructure partner may contribute the subsidy
amount required by the Credit Reform Act of 1990 in the form of
a credit risk premium. Once received, statutorily established
investigation charges are immediately available for appraisals
and necessary determinations and findings.
The conference agreement includes a further provision
mandating that no payment of principal or interest shall be
collected during fiscal year 2003 for the direct loan made to
the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.
Next Generation High-Speed Rail
The conference agreement provides $30,450,000 for the
next generation high-speed rail program as proposed by the
House instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The

--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total.............................................   $30,450,000
Diesel multiple units.--The conference agreement provides
$4,000,000 to validate the compliance of diesel multiple units
with existing passenger car safety standards and to make a
grant to a public body for the purpose of initiating a
demonstration in daily revenue service of a compliant DMU
during calendar years 2003 and 2004. Federal funding shall only
be made available if funds are matched on a dollar-for-dollar
basis from non-federal sources and shall only be used for
activities related to establishing the compliance of the DMU
design with passenger safety standards and for the acquisition
of DMUs (through a conventional competitive procurement
process) and service facilities necessary for revenue service
demonstration. All other expenses, including the cost of
passenger facilities and any net operating expenses are not
eligible for funding under this appropriation.
State of California.--Funds made available for high-speed
rail in California should supplement, not replace, state
funding for this same program.
Rail-highway crossing hazard eliminations.--Under section
1103 of TEA21, an automatic set-aside of $5,250,000 is made
available each year for the elimination of rail-highway
crossing hazards. A limited number of rail corridors are
eligible for these funds. Of these set-aside funds, the
following allocations are made:
Conference
High-speed rail corridor between Mobile, AL and New
Orleans, LA.........................................   $1,800,000
Pacific Northwest high-speed rail corridor..............    1,000,000
High-speed rail corridor between New York City and
Albany, NY..........................................     850,000
High-speed rail corridor in South Carolina..............     500,000
High-speed rail corridor between Milwaukee and LaCrosse,
WI..................................................     450,000
High-speed rail corridor between Staples Mill Station
and Main Street Station in Richmond, VA.............     200,000
High-speed rail corridor between Minneapolis/St. Paul,
MN and Chicago, IL (TEA21)..........................     250,000
High-speed rail corridor between Chicago, IL and St.
Louis, MO...........................................     200,000
Alaska Railroad Rehabilitation
The conference agreement provides $22,000,000 for the
Alaska Railroad instead of $25,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The House bill contained no similar appropriation.
Grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
The conference agreement provides $1,050,000,000 for
grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak)
instead of $762,476,000 as proposed by the House and
$1,200,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Within these funds:
$522,000,000 shall be for operating expenses; $295,000,000
shall be for capital expenses along the Northeast Corridor
Mainline; and $233,000,000 shall be for general capital
improvements. Funding is provided to the Secretary of
Transportation, who shall allocate these funds quarterly
through the grant making process. Funding is available until
September 30, 2003.
The Secretary of Transportation shall approve funding to
cover operating losses on a long distance train of the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation only after receiving and
reviewing a grant request for each specific train route. Each
request must be accompanied by detailed financial analysis and
revenue projections justifying federal support. Language,
proposed by the House, that limited operating expenses of long
distance trains to $150,000,000, has been deleted.
The Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak's Board of
Directors shall ensure that sufficient funds are reserved to
satisfy the Railroad's contractual obligations with commuter
and intercity passenger rail service.
The conference agreement slightly modifies a number of
reporting requirements proposed by the House. These
requirements include directing Amtrak to transmit to the House
and Senate Committees on Appropriations and the Secretary of
Transportation capital and operating plans, which must be used
as the base for expenditures in 2003. Funding may not be spent
on projects not included on the business plan. Beginning on
June 1, 2003, Amtrak shall submit supplemental reports
regarding the changes to the business plan and a justification
for such changes.
The conferees recognize that Amtrak has the authority to
transfer capital funds for operating expenses, such as
progressive overhauls, preventive maintenance, and maintenance
of way activities. This permission was granted in 1999.
However, the conferees expect that the Secretary of
Transportation shall notify the House and Senate Committees on
Appropriations of any such transfer of capital funds to
eligible operating expenses over and above those stipulated in
the original business plan.
As proposed by the House, the Secretary is prohibited
from obligating or expending any funds until Amtrak agrees to
continue abiding by certain direct loan provisions as agreed to
on June 28, 2002. Included in these provisions is a requirement
for Amtrak to identify $100,000,000 in cost savings options.
Accuracy of financial information.--The Secretary of
Transportation must vouch for the accuracy of financial
information that Amtrak provides to Congress. This must be in
the form of a signed letter that would accompany the operating
and capital plans. In doing so, the Secretary must certify in
writing, that based on his knowledge, the financial statements
and other financial information prepared by Amtrak for Congress
fairly presents in all material respects the financial
condition of the Corporation. Specific requirements are
discussed in the House report.
Reprogramming guidelines.--As detailed in the House
report, Amtrak must abide by the Department's reprogramming
guidelines. However, the conferees are willing to provide
Amtrak flexibility for increases and decreases in their
operating and capital plans of under $10,000,000 without
submitting a reprogramming request.
Short distance trains.--Amtrak shall establish a more
uniform methodology for cost sharing on short distance routes.
To do so, Amtrak should analyze current state funding for
operating expenses and capital improvements, review the
contractual terms under which this funding is provided, and
consult with states served by these routes to establish new
cost sharing procedures and increase state support on these
routes. Amtrak shall report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the status of these efforts by April 1,
2003.
Cost of long distance trains.--The conferees direct
Amtrak to report on the measures it undertakes, beginning in
fiscal year 2003, to reduce the financial burden of long
distance trains on the federal treasury. This report should
include specific estimates of cost savings to be achieved in
2003 and over a five-year period. This report is due to the
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than
April 1, 2003.
FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION
Administrative Expenses
The conference agreement provides $73,000,000 for
administrative expenses of the Federal Transit Administration
as proposed by both the House and the Senate. Within the total,
the conference agreement appropriates $14,600,000 from the
general fund.
The conference agreement includes a provision, contained
in both bills, that would reimburse the Department of
Transportation's Inspector General $2,000,000 for costs
associated with audits and investigations of transit-related
issues. The conference agreement also includes a provision that
limits the amount of funding available for the National transit
database to $2,600,000.
Full-time equivalent staff.--The conference agreement
approves the budget request for 12 new staff; however, funding
has been reduced for these positions by $549,000. The reduction
reflects half-year funding for these new positions, which is
consistent with hiring practices in other modes and by FTA last
year.
FECA administrative costs.--The conference agreement
deletes $15,000 proposed in the budget for FECA administrative
costs. This action is consistent across all modal
administrations.
Project and financial management oversight activities.--
The conferees direct that savings from funding new staff
positions at a half-year level and the denial of FECA
administrative costs should be used to increase funding for
project and financial management oversight activities
(+$564,000). The conferees further direct that the FTA submit
to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the
Inspector General and the General Accounting Office the
quarterly FMO and PMO reports for each project with a full
funding grant agreement.
Full funding grant agreements (FFGAs).--TEA21, as
amended, requires that the FTA notify the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations as well as the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on
Banking 60 days before executing a full funding grant
agreement. In its notification to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations, the conferees direct the FTA to
include therein the following: (a) a copy of the proposed full
funding grant agreement; (b) the total and annual federal
appropriations required for that project; (c) yearly and total
federal appropriations that can be reasonably planned or
anticipated for future FFGAs for each fiscal year through 2004;
(d) a detailed analysis of annual commitments for current and
anticipated FFGAs against the program authorization; and (e) a
financial analysis of the project's cost and sponsor's ability
to finance, which shall be conducted by an independent examiner
and shall include an assessment of the capital cost estimate
and the finance plan; the source and security of all public-
and private-sector financial instruments, the project's
operating plan which enumerates the project's future revenue
and ridership forecasts, and planned contingencies and risks
associated with the project.
The conferees also direct the FTA to inform the House and
Senate Committees on Appropriations before approving scope
changes in any full funding grant agreement. Correspondence
relating to scope changes shall include any budget revisions or
program changes that materially alter the project as originally
stipulated in the full funding grant agreement, and shall
include any proposed change in rail car procurements.
Formula Grants
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement provides a total program level
of $3,839,000,000 for transit formula grants, as proposed by

conference agreement appropriates $767,800,000 from the general
fund. The general fund appropriation shall be available until
expended.
The conference agreement provides that funding made
available under the clean fuels formula grant program under
this heading shall be transferred to and merged with funding
provided for the replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of
buses and related equipment and the construction of bus-related
facilities under ``Federal Transit Administration, Capital
investment grants''.

be used by the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority, any
affiliated agency or entity to pay either salary, benefits, or
expenses to the elected or appointed officers of the
Association of Commuter Rail Employees.
University Transportation Research
The conference agreement provides a total of $6,000,000

(LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)
(HIGHWAY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides $5,781,000,000 in
liquidating cash for the trust fund share of transit expenses
as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Capital Investment Grants
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conference agreement provides a total program level
of $3,036,000,000 to remain available until expended for
capital investment grants as proposed by the House and the
Senate. Within the total, the conference agreement appropriates
$607,200,000 from the general fund as proposed by both the
House and the Senate.
Within the total program level, $1,214,400,000 is
provided for fixed guideway modernization; $607,200,000 is
provided for the replacement, rehabilitation, and purchase of
buses and related equipment and the construction of bus-related
facilities; and $1,214,400,000 is provided for new fixed

In addition to the $607,200,000 for buses, the conference
agreement transfers $50,000,000 from formula funds to capital
investment grants for the replacement, rehabilitation, and
purchase of buses and related equipment and for the
construction of bus-related facilities, as proposed by the
House. The Senate also proposed the transfer of $50,000,000;
however, the bill language was slightly different.
In the new fixed guideway program, the conference
agreement supplements the $1,214,400,000 provided in this Act
by transferring $45,000,000 from the job access and reverse
commute grant program to the capital investment grant program.
The Senate proposed a transfer of $25,000,000 whereas the House
had no similar bill language. In addition, the conference
agreement transfers all in unobligated 1999 job access and
reverse commute program funds to capital investment grants and
makes this funding available for new fixed guideway systems.
Three year availability of section 5309 discretionary
funds.--The conferees direct the FTA to reprogram funds from
recoveries and previous appropriations that remain available
after three years and are available for reallocation to only
those new starts that have full funding grant agreements in
place on the date of enactment of this Act, and with respect to
bus and bus facilities, only to those bus and bus facilities
projects identified in the accompanying reports of the fiscal
year 2003 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act. The FTA shall notify the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations 15 days prior to any such proposed
reallocation. The conferees, however, direct the FTA not to

The conference agreement includes a total program level
of $150,000,000 for the job access and reverse commute grants
as proposed by both the House and the Senate. Within this
total, $30,000,000 is derived from the general fund. The
conference agreement includes a provision that waives the cap
for small urban and rural areas and provides that up to
$300,000 of the funds appropriated under this heading may be
used for technical assistance, technical support, and
performance reviews of the job access and reverse commute
grants program.
Of the total funding provided to the job access and
reverse commute grants program, $45,000,000 has been
transferred to the capital investment grants program instead of
a transfer of $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House
bill proposed no similar transfer. In addition, bill language
has been included that transfers the 1999 unobligated balances
from this program to the capital investment grants program.
Southeast Missouri Council.--Funding provided for fiscal
year 2002 for the Southeast Missouri Council shall also be made
available to the Mid-American Regional Council in Kansas City,

Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation
Operations and Maintenance
(HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement appropriates $14,086,000 for
operations and maintenance of the Saint Lawrence Seaway
Development Corporation.
Security.--The conferees applaud the initial security
efforts of the corporation and encourage the corporation to
continue the development of a high risk vessel assessment
protocol with assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard and
Transportation Security Administration.
FECA administrative costs.--The conferees have denied
funding proposed in the budget for FECA administrative costs.
This is consistent with actions taken DOT-wide.
RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION
Research and Special Programs
The conference agreement appropriates $40,980,000 for
research and special programs instead of $40,677,000 as
proposed by the House and $43,725,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Within this total, $3,250,000 is available until
September 30, 2005, as proposed by the House, instead of
$3,342,000 as proposed by the Senate. The following adjustments
are made to the budget estimate:
Reduce funding for prior year budget decisions..........    -$265,000
Reduce funding for emergency transportation detailee....    -107,000
Reduce funding for new program support decisions........    -790,000
Reduce funding for new IT infrastructure................   -2,239,000
Reduce funding for FECA administrative costs............     -3,000
The conference agreement permits up to $1,200,000 in fees
be collected and deposited in the general fund of the Treasury
as offsetting receipts. Also, the conference agreement includes
language that permits funds received from states, counties,
municipalities, other public authorities and private sources
for expenses incurred for training, reports publication and
dissemination, and travel expenses incurred in the performance
of hazardous materials exemptions and approval functions. The
House and Senate proposed both of these provisions.
Prior year funding decisions.--The budget included
$265,000 for reimbursement of salary and administrative funding
that Congress did not provide in the fiscal year 2002
appropriations Act. The conference agreement deletes funding
for this purpose, as proposed by the House.
New positions.--The budget requested a total of fourteen
new positions for RSPA's information management program. The
conference agreement has provided a total of two of these new
positions, one security officer and one network administrator/
computer analyst, as proposed by the House.
Emergency transportation detailee.--RSPA requested
$100,000 to pay for an existing detailee position from the
Department of Defense to serve as a liaison officer in the
office of emergency transportation. Because this position is
filled by an employee of the Department of Defense, not RSPA,
and detailees are customarily paid for by the sponsoring
department, the conferees delete funding for this purpose, as
proposed by the House. An additional $7,000 is also denied for
FECA-related costs.
Information technology infrastructure.--The conference
agreement has reduced funding by $2,239,000 from the request
for computer infrastructure, for a total funding level of
$1,500,000, as proposed by the House. The conferees direct RSPA
to focus its information technology investment funding on
safety and security related mission critical areas, such as
pipeline safety and hazardous materials areas, as well as on
addressing the internal and external computer-related security
threats identified by the March 2002 security posture
assessment report.
The conference committee further directs that no
additional funds shall be expended for consulting costs for
RSPA's business modernization initiative until a new Strategic
Information Technology Plan is submitted, as proposed by the
Senate. Further, RSPA shall provide this new Strategic
Information Technology Plan, of no more than fifteen pages, to
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by May 15,
2003, also proposed by the Senate. The report should identify a
detailed infrastructure spending plan, including an itemization
of resources and the sequence in which RSPA addresses security
and infrastructure needs.
Operation Respond.--The conferees agree to provide an
additional $1,500,000 to further accelerate the establishment
of a national first responder emergency services network. Funds
should be used for pilot programs at the Ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach, California, the Port of New York/New Jersey,
the Port of Mobile, Alabama, and the Port of Valdez, Alaska, to
provide chemical content verification and response information
for containers entering and exiting ports. Within the funds
provided, Operation Respond is also expected to address the
unique security concerns of rural America by developing model
first responder deployment programs in Eastern Kentucky.
FECA benefits.--The conference agreement has reduced
funding by $3,200 from the budget request for workers
compensation administrative costs, as proposed by the House.
User fees.--The conferees disagree with the budget
request to begin funding the hazardous materials safety program
from user fees, as proposed by both the House and Senate, and
deny this request.
PIPELINE SAFETY
(pipeline safety fund)
(OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND)
The conference agreement provides a total of $63,842,000
for the pipeline safety program, instead of $58,697,000 as
proposed by the House and $63,857,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Within this total, $24,823,000 is available until
September 30, 2005, as proposed by the Senate, instead of
$22,786,000 as proposed by the House.
Of this total, the conference agreement specifies that
[$7,472,000] shall be derived from the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund and [$56,370,000] from the Pipeline Safety Fund. The
House bill allocated $7,472,000 from the Oil Spill Liability
Trust Fund and $51,225,000 from the Pipeline Safety Trust Fund.
The Senate bill provided $7,472,000 from the Oil Spill
Liability Trust Fund and $56,385,000 from the Pipeline Safety
Fund. The following adjustments are made to the budget
estimate:
Reduce funding for FECA administrative costs............     -15,000
Research and development.--Within the funds provided,
$600,000 shall be used for airborne environmental laser mapping
technology research and engineering to support improved leak
detection, analysis, and response by federal, state, and
industry pipeline safety officials.
FECA benefits.--The conference agreement has reduced
funding by $15,000 from the budget request for workers
compensation administrative costs, as proposed by the House.
Emergency Preparedness Grants
(EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FUND)
The conference agreement provides $200,000 for emergency
preparedness grants as proposed by both the House and the
Senate. The conference agreement includes a limitation on
obligations of $14,300,000, consistent with both the House and
Senate proposals.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement includes $57,421,000 for the
office of inspector general, as proposed by the House and
Senate.
Surface Transportation Board
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conference agreement provides a funding level of
$19,450,000 for the Surface Transportation Board to fund
salaries and expenses from a direct appropriation, as proposed
by the House. The conference agreement includes language as
proposed by both the House and the Senate that allows the Board
to offset $1,000,000 of its appropriation from fees collected
during the fiscal year, for a total program level of
$18,450,000.
FECA administrative costs.--The conference agreement has
reduced funding by $9,100 from the budget request for workers
compensation administrative costs, as proposed by the House.
Union Pacific/Southern Pacific merger.--On December 12,
1997, the Board granted a joint request of Union Pacific
Railroad Company and the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County,
KS (Wichita/Sedgwick) to toll the 18-month mitigation study
pending in Finance Docket No. 32760. The decision indicated
that at such time as the parties reach agreement or discontinue
negotiations, the Board would take appropriate action.
By petition filed June 26, 1998, Wichita/Sedgwick and UP/
SP indicated that they had entered into an agreement, and
jointly petitioned the Board to impose the agreement as a
condition of the Board's approval of the UP/SP merger. By
decision dated July 8, 1998, the Board agreed and imposed the
agreement as a condition to the UP/SP merger. The terms of the
negotiated agreement remain in effect. If UP/SP or any of its
divisions or subsidiaries materially changes or is unable to
achieve the assumptions on which the Board based its final
environmental mitigation measures, then the Board should reopen
Finance Docket 32760 if requested by interested parties, and
prescribe additional mitigation properly reflecting these
changes if shown to be appropriate.

This is consistent with actions taken DOT-wide.

salaries and expenses of the National Transportation Safety
Board instead of $71,270,000 as proposed by the House and

$1,970,000 above the budget request and shall be used to
annualize 25 new positions, pay for true overtime costs for

initiatives that were recommended by an audit firm. No funding

Departmental Offices
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $189,201,000 instead of
$187,241,000 as proposed by the House and $191,887,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to non-recur
$2,854,000 of fiscal year 2002 costs, to transfer $446,000 out
of this account to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,
and to a business strategy adjustment of $599,000 as proposed
by the House. The conferees agree to provide $747,000 for
overseas inflation costs as proposed by the Senate and
$1,213,000 for full funding of fiscal year 2003 operations. The

$8,500,000 for the Office of Enforcement. The conferees agree
to a new general provision (Section 124) as proposed by the
Senate regarding the Office of Foreign Assets Control that
requires all travel license applications to be resolved within
90 calendar days and all travel license denials to include
written notification.
CERTIFICATE-BASED INTERNET SECURITY
The conferees are aware of the need for security in
permitting secure Internet communication for Customs, Secret
Service, and other Treasury law enforcement agents to prevent
cyber attacks and protect against identity theft in key
information systems. The conferees therefore strongly support
developing capability for certificate-based Internet security
projects to provide standards-based e-mail encryption and
digital signature capabilities; permit interoperability with
the Federal Bridge and other government public key
infrastructure systems and applications; demonstrate proven
scalability; support multiple platforms; and include automated,
secure key and certificate management. The conferees understand
that the Department of the Treasury believes this is a vital
priority. If funds become available in other Treasury accounts
during fiscal year 2003, the conferees are likely to look
favorably on a reprogramming request that would provide funding
for this critical initiative.
COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY TECHNOLOGY
The conferees agree that anti-counterfeiting measures for
currency are a critical component in the war on terrorism and
in promoting homeland security. The conferees strongly concur
with Senate guidance that directs the Department of the
Treasury to test the utility of using new technologies to help
identify the size of the universe of counterfeit currency and
better understand the circulation patterns of currency and
report back within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. The
conferees also encourage the Treasury Department to consider,
for future currency changes, the best available anti-
counterfeiting technology and security devices for currency,
including such features as optically variable devices,
alternative substrates, distinctive fibers, high-technology
inks, and new offset printing techniques.

the condition and infrastructure needs of the ports of entry
along the Northern Border. The conferees direct the Customs
Service to work closely with GSA in the development of its
construction plans and budgets, and to ensure that all current
and prospective requirements, particularly those recently
identified, will be met.
The conferees commend the actions of the United States
Customs Service to strengthen America's border with Canada. The
conferees support the full implementation of the 30-point
``Smart Border Accord,'' and other ongoing initiatives in
furtherance of securing the flow of people and goods, hardening
our infrastructure, and in sharing mutual enforcement
objectives with Canada. Implementation of programs such as pre-
clearance of U.S.-bound traffic, ``reverse inspections,''
hardening of remote ports, and expanded information sharing
promises increased security and important trade benefits on the
Northern Border. Additionally, the conferees encourage Customs
to expand use of ``smart'' processing and inspection
technologies such as the NEXUS program. This joint United
States-Canadian pilot is a dedicated commuter lane system that
allows Customs and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to rapidly identify and clear pre-registered frequent
travelers. The conferees urge Customs to implement an expansion
of the program expeditiously as an integral part of a layered
security framework that both secures our mutual border and
facilitates this unique trade relationship.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INITIATIVE AND CUSTOMS CYBERSMUGGLING
CENTER
The conferees have included funding for the continued
operation of the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Center,
which received $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2002, as well as to
annualize the costs of 13 additional full-time equivalent
positions. The conferees also continue funding for the Customs
Cybersmuggling Center (C3). The conferees have also included an
additional $1,400,000 to expand the IPR Center for domestic and
international programs, staffing, as well as continued
operation of the IPR Coordination Center. The conferees expect
the Customs Service will enhance the operations of the C3 and
the IPR Center to combat intellectual property rights
violations, and support law enforcement training of host
country officials by Customs overseas attaches. The conferees
encourage the IPR Center to use a portion of its funds to
establish a clearinghouse for intellectual property rights
information gathered from other federal as well as State and
local agencies.
STRENGTHENED ENFORCEMENT OF U.S. TRADE LAWS PERTAINING TO STEEL
The conferees support Customs enforcement of U.S. trade
laws, to include the President's steel 201 proclamation of
March 5, 2002, and all antidumping and countervailing duty
orders related to steel. The conferees also understand that
Customs is responsible for enforcing and monitoring imports of
wire rods and certain line pipe products previously covered by
a 201 remedy decision. The conferees are aware that Customs
personnel assigned to enforce antidumping and countervailing
duty orders, including import specialists, inspectors and
agents, have been increasingly burdened, and many have been
reassigned to meet homeland security priorities. The conferees
understand that Customs would require additional positions to
fully enforce this set of trade laws, and that there are
serious deficiencies in the level of training and specialized
knowledge of Customs inspectors and import specialists who deal
with steel tariff matters. The conferees therefore provide
$1,250,000 to permit Customs, working with the steel
manufacturing and trading community, to identify and apply the
resources and training required to carry out these
responsibilities. Such efforts may include utilizing steel
industry experts through a series of national training
seminars, which could be made available to members of the trade
and brokerage community who play a key role in classifying
imported goods for Customs processing. The funding may also be
used to assign more import specialists, inspectors, or agents
to steel trade enforcement. The conferees recommend that new
steel import specialists be assigned to ports with the greatest
volume of steel imports. In addition, the conferees urge that
the U.S. Customs Service enforce all steel-related laws and
regulations, including the President's steel 201 Proclamation
and all existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders, to
the fullest extent of the law. The conferees therefore direct
Customs to report not later than 60 days after enactment of
this Act on steps it has taken to improve training for steel
tariff implementation and to enhance enforcement efforts and
manpower, including data on types and value of illegal imports
seized and penalties imposed.
CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE
The Customs Service announced its Container Security
Initiative (CSI) on January 17, 2002, a critical effort to
protect U.S. seaports and maritime commerce. CSI will allow
targeting and screening of potentially dangerous cargo prior to
its arrival at U.S. ports. In March 2002 Customs began to
implement CSI in three Canadian ports; to date, 21 foreign
ports, including 18 of the world's top ``mega-ports'', have
agreed to participate. The CSI will entail staffing at each
site, as well as investments in non-intrusive inspection
technology or networking technology. The conferees include
$12,000,000 to continue this effort in fiscal year 2003.
The conferees are aware that CSI will require a data
system that permits the transfer of container images, other
sensor data, and relevant manifest data from foreign seaports
of origin to Customs offices at the U.S. port of destination
and to the Customs container management center. The conferees
would expect this network to be linked with the Treasury Secure
Data Network and capable of processing and sharing similar
domestic data as well. The conferees direct Customs to report
to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act on its plans for developing and
implementing such a network.
NON-INTRUSIVE INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY
The Administration's request includes $45,700,000 in new
investments in non-intrusive inspection and other security
technology, in addition to annualizing costs for investments
made in fiscal year 2002 to close gaps in land and seaport
security identified after September 11th. The conferees include
an additional $3,000,000 for these efforts, to be used for
technology acquisition and support of related research and
development, and to evaluate and prototype next-generation
technology to screen and detect contraband, explosives,
radioactive materials, and potential chemical and biological
weapons, with a focus on applications at major ports of entry.
The conferees strongly encourage the Customs Service to
maintain its policy of seeking to apply the most advanced and
cost-effective technology possible, and build into its planning
a life-cycle approach to replacing and upgrading such
capability to meet ever-increasing needs for greater
performance.
In general, the conferees expect Customs to regularly
review technologies that might have applications to Customs'
inspection needs, and evaluate the value for Customs' mission
that might be offered by technology, such as computed
tomography (CT), which is being employed for airport security
by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA); the Total
Asset Visibility Network employed by the Defense Department; or
neutron analysis technology. Customs should emphasize
evaluating inspection technologies that do not require human
evaluation and analysis, and work closely with the Departments
of Defense and Energy agencies such as the Defense Threat
Reduction Agency and the National Nuclear Security
Administration on placement of systems to detect nuclear,
biological and chemical threats. The conferees direct Customs
to report not later than 120 days after enactment of this Act
on its implementation of this program.
PEACE BRIDGE JOINT BORDER FACILITY
The conferees endorse the Senate explanatory language
calling for the U.S. Customs Service, in consultation with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of
Homeland Security to report within 180 days of enactment of
this Act detailing how a joint United States/Canadian border
inspection facility could be established on the Canadian side
of the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, Ontario.
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
The conferees direct the Customs Service to continue
providing $100,000 of available funds to promote public
awareness for the child pornography tipline, including ongoing
efforts to make children aware of the tipline, in fiscal year
2003. The conferees recommend that the Customs Service continue
to coordinate this effort with the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children and the U.S. Postal Service to ensure
that the publicity is diversified and effective.
FORCED CHILD LABOR
The conferees are pleased with the work of the Customs
Service to enforce section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as it
relates to forced and indentured child labor. The conferees
believe that continued focus on enforcement of the ban on
importation of goods made by forced child labor is critical and
that Customs needs to continue this effort through aggressive
investigation and enforcement of the applicable laws. The
conferees direct Customs to expend an additional $4,000,000 on
this important enforcement effort.
DAIRY PROTEIN BLENDS
The conferees are concerned with the impact of imported
milk protein concentrates on domestic milk use, resulting in
historically low milk prices paid to dairy producers. The
Customs Service is encouraged to make their final decision on
reclassification of dairy protein blends within 30 days of the
enactment of this Act and report the results to the Committees
on Appropriations.
Harbor Maintenance Fee Collection
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $3,000,000 as proposed by
the House and the Senate.
Operation, Maintenance and Procurement, Air and Marine Interdiction
Programs
The conferees agree to provide $181,829,000 instead of
$190,000,000 as proposed by the House and $177,829,000 as
proposed by the Senate. This includes $7,000,000 for the
Customs National Aviation Center and $4,000,000 to support
other critical operational and maintenance needs and
modernization requirements such as the Air and Marine
Interdiction Coordination Center, development of tactical data
link and display capability, enhanced electro-optical and
infrared capability, and replacement of critical fixed wing and
helicopter platforms.
AIR AND MARINE PROGRAM MODERNIZATION AND ORGANIZATION REVIEW
The conferees are aware that Customs had been conducting
a comprehensive review of the missions, operations, structure,
and resources of the Air and Marine Interdiction Division
(AMID). As Customs conducts this review, the conferees strongly
urge it to take full account of the impact of its various and
expanding missions in order to achieve an optimal level of
readiness and operational effectiveness. Particular attention
should be paid to organization, infrastructure, aircraft,
vessels, equipment, staffing and funding.
The conferees also expect Customs to make the most
effective use of existing resources to carry out its missions.
Replacement or other modernization of Customs assets is
expensive and must be carried out in the context of an orderly
program to assess requirements for necessary platforms based on
mission and operational needs, including operating and
maintenance costs. The conferees expect Customs to carefully
evaluate the impact of maintenance contracts on meeting mission
needs, and how the form such contracts take affects such goals:
to maximize operational availability and capability of aircraft
and marine vessels; to rationalize time and logistics required
for system maintenance and support; and to achieve cost
effectiveness. The conferees direct the Customs Service to
submit the findings of its review upon its completion,
including those relating to maintenance and support, but in any
event not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act.
In the course of preparing the report, the conferees
request that Customs describe how its modernization plan will
address (1) implementing airborne law enforcement surveillance
and support capabilities along the Northern Border; (2)
acquiring platforms for Northern Border Surveillance Aircraft;
(3) replacing or modifying existing Citation aircraft; and (4)
meeting its requirements for light enforcement and medium-lift
helicopters. Customs will continue to implement the Western
Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (WHDEA) and the conferees
include the $35,764,000 requested by the Administration. The
conferees provide an additional $4,000,000 that may be used for
system acquisition and support, and expect plans for use of
this funding to be included in the modernization plan and
detailed in the above mentioned report.
AUTOMATION MODERNIZATION
The conferees agree to provide $435,332,000 as proposed
by the Senate instead of $439,332,000 as proposed by the House.
AUTOMATED COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT
The conferees believe that strong oversight of the
Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) program is essential to
ensure that Customs fulfills its expenditure and development
plans. Periodic review of investment increments associated with
capital planning and architecture development is consistent
with best practices for information technology procurement. The
conferees therefore direct that Customs provide quarterly
reports to the Committees on Appropriations until ACE becomes
functional.
The conferees also direct Customs to submit requests for
release of funds, including a cost-benefit analysis, in a
timely manner, but in no case less than 30 days before the
anticipated need for the funds.
WEST COAST SECURED CORRIDOR INITIATIVE
The conferees are aware of efforts by the Washington
State Office of Trade and Economic Development, the Washington
State Department of Transportation, and the Cascadia Project of
the Discovery Institute to establish a West Coast Secured
Corridor Initiative. This initiative will establish a forum for
coordinating the development and implementation of practices
vital to the enhancement of homeland security and the secured
mobility of goods and people along the West Coast, and that
will ensure interoperability of Customs and other regulatory
protocols for transport between Mexico, the United States, and
Canada. The conferees strongly support collaborative efforts
between Federal, State and local governments and non-profit
organizations that can facilitate both security and the smooth
flow of commerce along our borders. The Customs Service should
evaluate the benefits of ensuring that development and
deployment of ACE and the International Trade Data System
(ITDS) takes into account the efforts of the Initiative to
ensure homeland security and secured mobility of goods and
people along the West Coast.
United States Mint

The conferees agree to provide $34,900,000 for capital
investments for circulating coinage and protective services as
proposed by the House and the Senate.
Bureau of The Public Debt
ADMINISTERING THE PUBLIC DEBT
The conferees agree to provide $190,068,000 instead of
$168,673,000 as proposed by the House and $191,073,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to a reduction of
$2,000,000 to the savings bond marketing program; the funds
that remain for savings bond marketing are to provide for the
orderly termination of this effort during fiscal year 2003
consistent with the plans of the Department of the Treasury.
The conferees direct the Department to report to the Committees
on Appropriations within 30 days of the enactment of this Act
with details of how they will conduct this orderly termination
of the savings bond marketing program. The conferees further
agree to include a provision to assist with the termination of
the savings bond marketing program; this provision extends the
availability of $4,000,000 for two years in order to cover
certain costs such as severance requirements and workman
compensation payments that will extend beyond fiscal year 2003.
The conferees also agree to provide $995,000 for the full
funding of fiscal year 2003 operations not associated with the
savings bond marketing program.
Internal Revenue Service
The conferees recognize the fiscal challenges that face
the Internal Revenue Service and direct that base operations be
funded before embarking upon any new initiatives.
PROCESSING, ASSISTANCE, AND MANAGEMENT
The conferees agree to provide $3,955,777,000 as proposed
by the Senate instead of $3,955,077,000 as proposed by the
House. The conferees agree to include a provision that provides
$7,000,000 for low-income taxpayer clinic grants, as proposed
by the Senate.
TAX LAW ENFORCEMENT
The conferees agree to provide $3,729,072,000 as proposed
by the House and the Senate. The conferees agree to include a
provision modified from one proposed by the Senate that not
less than $60,000,000 shall be used to combat abusive tax
shelters.

$436,000,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate.
HEALTH INSURANCE TAX CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
The conferees agree to provide $70,000,000 instead of no
appropriation as proposed by the House and the Senate. This new
account is to be used to implement the health insurance tax
credit program included in the Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law
107-210).

TITLE II--POSTAL SERVICE
Payment to the Postal Service Fund
The conferees agree to provide $60,014,000, as proposed
by the House and Senate. Of this amount $31,014,000 is provided
as an advance appropriation for free mail to the blind and
overseas voters, as proposed by the House and Senate. The
conferees include an additional $29,000,000 for prior year
reimbursement shortfalls.
Postal Service Marketing Efforts
The conferees are aware that the Postal Service has
entered into a four-year $25,000,000 contract to sponsor a
cycling team to provide the Postal Service with marketing
exposure. This expenditure comes at a time when the Postal
Service is suffering from long-term declines in mail volume and
net income, as well as the huge added costs of guarding against
biological terrorist attacks through the U.S. mail system. The
conferees are concerned that the Postal Service has incurred
this $25,000,000 obligation even though no proof has been
offered that this sponsorship will result in increased
revenues. The conferees urge the Postal Service to exercise far
better judgment in making future investment decisions in favor
of those efforts that can provide tangible results.
Postal Service Printing
The conferees are aware that significant cost savings can
be achieved by utilizing electronic commerce technology in the
ordering and procurement of supporting goods and services, such
as printing requirements. The conferees encourage the Postal
Service to use e-commerce means in the purchasing of its
printing, including testing the feasibility of procuring
printing through e-commerce means after assessing the market
and conducting a test or limited pilot project, if the test or
project can include a guaranteed cost savings feature and
acceptable return on investment (ROI). If this test or limited
pilot yields a cost savings and acceptable ROI for the Postal
Service, the conferees encourage the Postal Service to expand
its use of e-commerce means in the procurement of its printing
needs. The conferees request a report from the Postal Service
on any such test or pilot project undertaken no later than six
months after the date of enactment of this Act.
HOUSTON, TEXAS
The conferees are concerned by the quality of service at
the Jensen Drive Postal Station in Houston, Texas. The
conferees are specifically concerned with the adequacy of the
facility at this postal station. The station currently has only
eight available parking slots, of which one is for disabled
customers and two are for senior citizens who represent a large
portion of this station's customers, leaving only five
available slots for all other customers. This lack of adequate
parking creates traffic and safety problems. The conferees
direct the Postal Service to evaluate the options for
addressing the parking situation and other problems at Jensen
Drive and report to the Committees on Appropriations on steps
being taken to address the problem no later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act.
BRONX, NEW YORK
The conferees are very concerned by the repeated reports
of poor quality service to postal customers in the Bronx,
including missing mail, wrongly delivered mail, and late
delivery. The House Committee on Appropriations earlier
directed the Postal Service to investigate the situation at the
Morris Park post office and report its recommendations for
corrective action to the Committee, and the Postal Service
provided this report in January 2003. The conferees direct the
Postal Service to expand its investigation to the Highbridge,
Stadium, Morrisania, and Tremont stations, as well as the
General Post Office, and report its findings and
recommendations for corrective action and a plan of
implementation to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than 120 days following enactment of this Act.
TITLE III--EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO
THE PRESIDENT
Compensation of the President and the White House Office
COMPENSATION OF THE PRESIDENT
The conferees agree to provide $450,000 as proposed by
the House and the Senate.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $50,715,000 as proposed by
the House instead of $59,735,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees agree to transfer $9,020,000 to the Office of
Administration in support of a pilot program to centralize the
procurement of certain common goods and services.
White House Tours
The conferees are aware that, because of the tragic
events of September 11, 2001, public visitation of the White
House has been severely restricted. The conferees would like to
see a resumption of public White House tours as soon as safely
possible. In light of this goal, within 30 days of enactment of
this Act, the White House Office should provide a report to the
Committees that details the status of efforts underway to
safely reopen public tours of the White House.
Office of Homeland Security
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $19,398,000 instead of
$24,061,000 as proposed by the House and $24,844,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to transfer
$783,000 to the Office of Administration in support of a pilot
program to centralize the procurement of certain common goods
and services. The conferees do not include $4,663,000 in funds
proposed for various costs associated with the operations of
the Nebraska Avenue complex. The conferees are aware of an
unobligated balance of $3,745,200 in fiscal year 2002
supplemental appropriations for Nebraska Avenue; and the
conferees also note that funds were transferred through the
authority provided in Public Law 107-294 for various Nebraska
Avenue operations. The conferees note that detailed
justification materials related to the funds transferred under
the authority of Public Law 107-294 have not yet been provided
to the Committee. Given the availability of these other funding
sources, the conferees defer consideration of the $4,663,000
proposed for Nebraska Avenue operations.
Executive Office of the President Mail Processing
The conferees are concerned by ongoing difficulties
associated with mail processing for the Executive Office of the
President (EOP) complex. The conferees are further concerned by
the absence of a business case analysis for mail processing
efforts, including a precise definition of both user and system
requirements. The conferees are aware of proposed plans to
transfer $9,000,000 of fiscal year 2003 funds from the Office
of Homeland Security to the Department of Homeland Security for
EOP mail processing. The conferees support this transfer of
responsibilities and encourage the Office of Administration to
move expeditiously toward this goal. The Office of
Administration is directed to report back to the Committees on
all efforts to transfer funds and responsibilities for this
effort to the Department of Homeland Security no later than 60
days after enactment of this Act.

conferees agree to transfer $970,000 to the Office of
Administration in support of a pilot program to centralize the
procurement of certain common goods and services.
National Security Council
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $7,821,000 instead of
$7,803,000 as proposed by the House and $9,525,000 as proposed
by the Senate. The conferees agree to transfer $1,704,000 to
the Office of Administration in support of a pilot program to
centralize the procurement of certain common goods and
services.
Office of Administration
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $91,505,000 instead of
$92,681,000 as proposed by the House and $70,128,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to transfer
$21,377,000 from the White House Office, the Office of Homeland
Security, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of
Policy Development, the National Security Council, and the
Council of Economic Advisers to the Office of Administration to
establish a pilot project for centralized procurement and
management of information technology, rent, printing and
reproduction, supplies and materials and equipment. The
conferees expect that the Office of Administration will achieve
economies of scale using centralized procurement practices and
directs the Office of Administration to identify these savings
within 120 days of enactment of this Act. The conferees direct
the Office of Administration to submit a description of this
pilot project, including a description of the standards
established for the procurement of each commodity included in
this project, no later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act.
Office of Management and Budget
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $62,394,000 instead of
$61,492,000 as proposed by the House and $70,752,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to transfer
$8,258,000 to the Office of Administration in support of a
pilot program to centralize the procurement of certain common
goods and services. The conferees are aware that the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) has achieved savings in excess of
$100,000 through the use of the Government Printing Office to
print the President's fiscal year 2004 budget. The conferees
have reduced OMB's appropriation by this amount and direct OMB
to apply this reduction to OMB-Wide Offices. The conferees
further encourage OMB to apply this reduction to those
functions and activities that have no direct impact on the
formulation or execution of the President's fiscal priorities,
such as the Communications Office.
Contracting Out Quotas
The conferees agree to a Senate provision prohibiting the
use of funds to establish, apply, or enforce any numerical
goal, target, or quota for contracting out unless the goal,
target, or quota is based on considered research and sound
analysis of past activities and is consistent with the stated
mission of the executive agency. Although the Senate provision
was somewhat different than the provision adopted by the House,
the conferees want to emphasize the strong opposition in both
chambers to the establishment of arbitrary goals, targets, and
quotas. If any goals, targets, or quotas are established
following ``considered research and sound analysis'' under the
terms of this provision, the conferees direct the Office of
Management and Budget to provide a report to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than 30 days following the announcement
of those goals, targets, or quotas, specifically detailing the
research and sound analysis that was used in reaching the
decision.
Electronic Government (E-Gov) Fund
The conferees agree to include funds for the Electronic
Government Fund within the General Services Administration, as
proposed by the Senate.
Election Administration Reform and Related Expenses
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees address this issue in a separate Division
of this Act.
Office of National Drug Control Policy
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $26,456,000 as proposed by
the Senate instead of $24,458,000 as proposed by the House. The
conferees include $1,000,000 for the National Alliance for
Model State Drug Laws. The conferees have included a provision
that withholds $2,000,000 from obligation until the Director
submits, and the Committees on Appropriations approve, a human
capital strategy for the Office of National Drug Control Policy
(ONDCP).
COUNTERDRUG TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT CENTER
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $48,000,000 instead of
$40,000,000 as proposed by the Senate and $55,800,000 as
proposed by the House. This includes $22,000,000 for
counternarcotics Technology Research and Development and
$26,000,000 for the Technology Transfer Program. The conferees
have included continued funding for neuroimaging studies and
genomic research into the relationship between genetic
predisposition and environmental factors bearing upon drug
addiction in the amount for counternarcotics Technology
Research and Development.
Federal Drug Control Programs
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $226,350,000 as proposed
by the Senate instead of $246,350,000 as proposed by the House.
The conferees provide that existing HIDTAs shall be funded at
no less than the fiscal year 2002 levels prior to the
obligation of the $20,000,000 in additional funds provided for
fiscal year 2002, unless the Director submits to the Committees
on Appropriations, and the Committees approve, justification
for changes in those levels based on clearly articulated
priorities for the HIDTA program, as well as published ONDCP
performance measures of effectiveness. The conferees also
provide that no funds in excess of the fiscal year 2003 budget
request shall be obligated without the prior approval of the
Committees.
HIDTA Performance Management
The conferees remain concerned by ONDCP's lack of
progress in developing performance measures of effectiveness
(PMEs) for the HIDTA program. The conferees believe that the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of individual HIDTAs, and
to rationally match funding needs against budgets, depends on a
reliable and consistent methodology for performance measurement
and management. The conferees provide, under the Salaries and
Expenses account, that $5,000,000 shall not be obligated until
the Director of ONDCP submits PMEs for the HIDTA program to the
Committees. The conferees further direct ONDCP to provide a
justification, based on PMEs, of the fiscal year 2004 budget
request for each individual HIDTA, as well as an optimal
spending allocation for each individual HIDTA based upon PMEs,
to the Committees when PMEs for the HIDTA program are
submitted.
Southwest Border HIDTA
The conferees are concerned by the repeated reports of
the conflict within the Southwest Border HIDTA between the five
regional partnerships and the central office. The Southwest
Border HIDTA was created in 1990 and is unique among HIDTAs in
that it is structured into five partnerships--Arizona,
California Border Alliance Group, New Mexico, South Texas, and
West Texas--plus an Executive Director's office based in El
Paso, Texas. The conferees believe that this regional structure
has worked effectively to cover a very large multi-State
geographical area that is crucial to anti-drug law enforcement.
At the same time, the conferees believe that the HIDTA program
needs coordination and rationalization to ensure that scarce
resources can be targeted to those areas demonstrating both the
greatest need and the greatest programmatic impact. The
conferees believe that these goals can be met without altering
the basic structure of the Southwest Border HIDTA. The
conferees agree to provide that no funds shall be used for the
further or additional consolidation of the Southwest Border
HIDTA, except for the operation of an office with a
coordinating role, until ONDCP provides a report on the
Southwest Border HIDTA. The conferees direct ONDCP to
investigate the situation in the Southwest Border HIDTA and
provide this report to the Committees on Appropriations within
120 days of enactment of this Act. This report shall include
ONDCP's recommendations for resolving conflicts related to
management and budgeting within the Southwest Border HIDTA, and
shall include written statements from each of the partnerships
expressing that partnership's views of the situation.
SPECIAL FORFEITURE FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $223,200,000 instead of
$240,800,000 as proposed by the House and $172,700,000 as
proposed by the Senate. This includes $150,000,000 for the
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, $60,000,000 for the
Drug-Free Communities Support Program, $3,000,000 for the
Counterdrug Intelligence Executive Secretariat, $2,000,000 for
Performance Measures Development, $6,400,000 for the US Anti-
Doping Agency, $1,000,000 for the National Drug Court
Institute, and $800,000 for dues to the World Anti-Doping
Agency. The conferees provide that $2,000,000 of Drug-Free
Communities funds shall be used to make a grant directly to the
Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to establish and
maintain the National Community Anti-Drug Coalition Institute
as proposed by the Senate, instead of no provision as proposed
by the House.
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign
The conferees are deeply disturbed by the lack of
evidence that the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has
had any appreciable impact on youth drug use. With the funds
provided for fiscal year 2003, expenditures on the Media
Campaign will be over $1,000,000,000 since the program's
inception in fiscal year 1998. While the evaluation conducted
under the auspices of the National Institute for Drug Abuse
(NIDA) has shown that the Media Campaign has had a slight and
sporadic impact on the attitudes of parents, it has had no
significant impact on youth behavior. While the conferees are
aware of surveys, such as Monitoring the Future, that show
recent declines in youth drug use, the NIDA study was
undertaken to measure the specific impact of the Media
Campaign, not simply to gauge general trends. The conferees
have not included a provision requiring ONDCP to spend a
certain amount on media buys for the Media Campaign as proposed
by the House. The conferees expect ONDCP to allocate not less
than the amount provided in fiscal year 2002 to support the
non-advertising public communication activities of the Media
Campaign.
The Director has inaugurated certain changes in the
direction of the Media Campaign, such as producing new ads
demonstrating the link between drug use and terrorism and other
criminal activity, as well as an intensive anti-marijuana
campaign launched in fall of 2002 and a shift in the youth age
group focus of the campaign. The conferees are hopeful that
these and other changes will result in the achievement of the
campaign's goal of reducing youth drug use. The conferees
intend to rely on the scientifically rigorous NIDA study to
gauge the ultimate impact of the campaign. If the campaign
continues to fail to demonstrate effectiveness, then the
Committees will be compelled to reevaluate the use of taxpayer
money to support the Media Campaign.
US Anti-Doping Agency
The conferees include $6,400,000 for the US Anti-Doping
Agency (USADA). Within this amount, the conferees include
$500,000 for the development of a school-based program for
educating young athletes on the risks associated with dietary
supplements. Not only are certain supplements banned from use
by USADA, many supplements contain steroid precursors (which
the body metabolizes into testosterone), such as
androstenedione, androstendiol, and DHEA. Studies have shown
that these steroid precursors are being used by young athletes
as performance-enhancing drugs at an alarming rate, even as
early as the grade school level. The conferees believe that an
education program is therefore necessary to make our young
athletes aware of the risks associated with certain dietary
supplements.
UNANTICIPATED NEEDS
The conferees agree to provide $1,000,000 as proposed by
the House and Senate.
TITLE IV--INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $4,658,000 instead of
$4,629,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. This
includes $29,000 to fully fund fiscal year 2003 operations.
Federal Election Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to include $49,866,000 instead of
$49,426,000 as proposed by the House and $45,244,000 as
proposed by the Senate. This includes $4,198,000 to implement
the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and $424,000 to fully fund
fiscal year 2003 operations. The conferees do not include a
$16,000 general reduction, as proposed by the House.
Federal Labor Relations Authority
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $28,950,000 instead of
$28,677,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. This
includes $273,000 to fully fund fiscal year 2003 operations.
General Services Administration
REAL PROPERTY ACTIVITIES
FEDERAL BUILDINGS FUND
LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABILITY OF REVENUE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $7,006,033,000 in new
obligational authority instead of $6,961,930,000 as proposed by
the House and $7,006,518,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees directly appropriate $375,711,000 into the Fund to
cover a portion of the new obligational needs of the Fund.
CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITION
The conferees agree to provide $717,488,000 instead of
$646,385,000 as proposed by the House and $631,663,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree with the direction
proposed by the Senate with respect to the Rosenn Federal
Courthouse in Wilkes-Barre, PA. The conferees concur with the
direction provided in House Report 107-575 on the new
courthouse in Chattanooga, TN, and urge the General Services
Administration (GSA) to keep this project on schedule (site
acquisition and design for fiscal year 2005 and construction
for fiscal year 2007).
Springfield, Massachusetts Courthouse
The conferees are aware that the General Services
Administration has identified more than $2,000,000 in
additional security features that exceed the original criteria
for the Springfield Courthouse in Massachusetts. The conferees
expect GSA to fulfill these additional security requirements
within the current budget estimates for the project or through
a reprogramming request.
REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS
The conferees agree to provide $951,529,000 instead of
$978,529,000 as proposed by the House and $997,839,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Of the amount provided, $358,340,000 is
for basic repairs and alterations. The conferees elected not to
include amounts for specific projects and programs in the bill;
however, the conferees direct the General Services
Administration to provide the Committees on Appropriations,
within 60 days of enactment of this Act, a plan for expenditure
of the funds which includes the specific projects and programs
to be accomplished and the amounts proposed for each.
The conferees remain concerned about the plans for
repairing and upgrading the Post Office and Federal Building in
Pittsburgh, PA, and direct GSA to seriously consider requesting
any additional needs there might be for this project through
reprogramming. The conferees agree with the Senate direction
within the construction activity rather than the House
direction within this account concerning the needs of the
Rosenn Federal Courthouse in Wilkes-Barre, PA.
Eisenhower Executive Office Building
The conferees are keenly aware of the deplorable
condition of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and the
critical need to move forward on a major multi-year repair and
alteration project for this property. The conferees remain
severely disappointed with information provided by the Office
of Management and Budget and GSA and very concerned with the
lack of clear, consistent, and timely decision-making by this
Administration on this project. The conferees believe that the
current lack of progress on planning the entire modernization
effort does a serious disservice to the Administration and the
affected personnel and that it would be premature and
inappropriate to fund incomplete design efforts in a piecemeal
fashion.
INSTALLMENT ACQUISITION PAYMENTS
The conferees agree to provide $178,960,000 as proposed
by the House and the Senate.
RENTAL OF SPACE
The conferees agree to provide $3,113,211,000 instead of
$3,153,211,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate.
NOAA Operations and Science Center
The conferees are aware that GSA is currently reviewing
expressions of interest for an assignable land option in the
College Park/Greenbelt Area of Prince George's County,
Maryland, for the NOAA Operations and Science Center. Further,
the conferees are concerned that the lease prospectus for this
project has not been submitted to Congress for approval.
Therefore, the conferees expect the Administration to submit
the lease prospectus to the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and
Public Works for approval no later than 30 days following the
enactment of this Act.
BUILDING OPERATIONS
The conferees agree to provide $1,965,160,000 as proposed
by the Senate instead of $1,925,160,000 as proposed by the
House. The conferees anticipate that the House of
Representatives will be a primary tenant of FOB 8. The
conferees strongly encourage GSA to move forward with the
ongoing discussions with representatives of the City of Canton,
Ohio, involving the Frank T. Bow Federal Building with the goal
of finding suitable housing for federal tenants in the Canton
area, which includes the option of building a new federal
building.
Angel Island Immigration
The conferees direct GSA to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations within 30 days after the date of
enactment on the status of the Angel Island Immigration Station
which outlines the role of the GSA, the National Park Service,
the National Archives, and any other relevant Federal agency in
the effort to properly maintain, preserve and restore the
Station as a national landmark.
Policy and Citizen Services
The conferees agree to provide $66,304,000 instead of
$65,995,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. The
conferees agree to include $309,000 for full funding for fiscal
year 2003 operations.
OPERATING EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $83,663,000 instead of
$77,904,000 as proposed by the House and $94,640,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to include two
reductions, $6,436,000 for Governor's Island and $5,450,000 for
the full non-recur of five fiscal year 2002 items, as proposed
by the House. The conferees also agree to include the following
increases: $2,000,000 as a transfer to the New York State
Historical Society for exhibits, education, collections, and
research associated with the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks; $150,000 as a transfer to the Association of Central
Oklahoma Governments for establishing alternative fuel
facilities; $1,500,000 for the virtual archive storage
terminal; $300,000 for the Upper Great Plains Native American
Telehealth program; $300,000 for the University of Colorado
Health Science Center's Digital Telehealth project; $1,750,000
for the government rural outreach initiative; $125,000 as a
transfer to the North Dakota State Historical Society for the
veteran's oral history project; $1,000,000 for financial
transaction software; $250,000 as a transfer to the Boston
Public Library for the Adams collection; $250,000 as a transfer
to the State of Alaska to assist in preparation for its
Statehood celebration; $250,000 as a transfer to the State of
Hawaii to assist in preparation for its Statehood celebration;
and $534,000 for full funding for fiscal year 2003 operations.
The conferees also direct that, should the United States
Consensus Council become authorized, GSA is to provide the
council $1,000,000 from within existing funds to initiate the
effort.
Office of Inspector General
The conferees agree to provide $37,916,000 instead of
$37,617,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. The
conferees agree to include $299,000 for the full funding of
fiscal year 2003 operations.
Electronic Government Fund
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $5,000,000 as proposed by
the Senate instead of no funds as proposed by the House; the
House had included $5,000,000 within the Executive Office of
the President. The conferees note that proposals for using this
funding are to meet capital planning guidelines and include
adequate documentation to demonstrate a sound business case,
attention to security and privacy, and a way to measure
performance against planned results. The Office of Management
and Budget is to control the allocation of the fund and direct
its use for information systems projects that affect multiple
agencies and offer the greatest improvements in access and
services.
Allowances and Office Staff for Former Presidents
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $3,339,000 as proposed by
the House and the Senate.
Election Reform Reimbursements
The conferees agree to provide $15,000,000 to GSA for a
program of payments to States that obtained optical scan or
electronic voting equipment for the administration of Federal
elections prior to the November 2000 election. These funds are
in addition to election reform funding provided in a separate
Division of this Act.

SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

POLICY TRUST FUND
The conferees agree to provide $1,996,000 as proposed by
the House and the Senate.
ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION FUND
The conferees agree to provide $1,309,000 as proposed by
the House and the Senate.
National Archives and Records Administration
OPERATING EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $249,875,000 instead of
$249,731,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. The
conferees agree not to include funding for the Homeland
Security records activities initiative. The conferees agree to
provide $144,000 for the full funding of fiscal year 2003
operations. The conferees agree to include two provisions as
proposed by the House, the first regarding the electronic
records archive and the second regarding the records of the
Freedman's Bureau.
REPAIRS AND RESTORATION
The conferees agree to provide $14,208,000 as proposed by
the Senate instead of $10,458,000 as proposed by the House. The
conferees agree to include $3,750,000 for site acquisition
associated with a new regional facility in Anchorage, Alaska;
this work is to be conducted by the National Archives in the
best and most efficient manner possible.
NATIONAL HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION GRANTS PROGRAM
The conferees agree to provide $6,500,000 instead of
$7,000,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. Several
specific concerns voiced by the Senate in its guidance have
been addressed in the GSA Operating Expenses account.
Office of Government Ethics
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The conferees agree to provide $10,557,000 instead of
$10,486,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. This
includes $71,000 to fully fund fiscal year 2003 operations.
Office of Personnel Management
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF TRUST FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $129,486,000 instead of
$128,986,000 as proposed by the House and $128,736,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Telecommuting Training Program
The conferees include $500,000 to carry out a
Telecommuting Training Program as proposed by the House. The
purpose of the program is to educate executive branch managers
about the benefits and logistics of telecommuting. The
conferees note that while the proportion of telecommuters in
the Federal government increased significantly from 1 percent
in 1999 to 4.2 percent in 2001, telecommuting rates at some
federal agencies remain very low and manager reluctance is the
most frequently cited barrier to telecommuting. The conferees
believe that, under this program, an effort should be made to
encourage managers, through the performance planning and
evaluation process, to assess and, where appropriate, create
telecommuting plans for their offices and staff. The conferees
direct the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to target
executive agencies where less than 2 percent of employees
telecommute.
Retirement Readiness
The conferees are aware that OPM has the mission to look
out for the retirement welfare of Federal employees, primarily
through retirement counseling and pre-retirement seminars to
agency employees. OPM has communicated to the conferees that
``improving the retirement readiness of Federal employees is
part of our objective to help Federal agencies use effective
merit-based human capital strategies to create a rewarding work
environment that accomplishes the mission.'' OPM has also
recognized, however, that it does not currently have the
resources targeted to establish a methodology to examine the
real rate of Americans' ``retirement readiness'' and to develop
a retirement education model, which is crucial for their being
able to accomplish that objective. To fill this need, OPM has
recognized that the International Foundation for Retirement
Education (InFRE) can provide OPM with the methodology and
model that they require.
OPM and InFRE have proposed that InFRE will perform a
preliminary research project on the ``retirement readiness'' of
the American worker, the scope and deliverables of which are:
(1) create a research team to include members from InFRE's top
retirement professional and academic resources, together with
representatives from OPM, Department of Labor, and the
Department of Treasury; (2) develop research and methodology to
identify and define a generally acceptable index of
``retirement readiness'' for the individual worker or plan
participant; (3) develop initial methodology and strategies
with which to test for ``retirement readiness'' among a cross
section of employee (and employer) groups, segmented by
geography, income, ethnicity, gender, etc.; (4) implement a
pilot program consisting of a series of diverse field tests to
establish the accuracy and efficiency of the developed
methodology among a cross section of the workforce; (5) analyze
the findings and make any necessary changes and enhancements to
the models to be employed, performing additional pilot tests as
required while simultaneously identifying existing best
practices and/or workforce barriers; and (6) prepare a report
to OPM, Department of Labor, and Department of Treasury that
will present the research project's analysis, findings,
conclusions, and recommendations, to include a working
definition of the widely used but yet undefined term of
``retirement readiness,'' and outline a validated methodology
for more advanced research on ``retirement readiness'' in the
future.
The conferees concur with OPM's concerns for providing
better retirement counseling, especially in light of the fast
approaching retirements of the ``Baby Boomer'' cohort. Within
the amounts provided to OPM, the conferees include $250,000 for
OPM to award as a grant or contract to InFRE to conduct the
research project described in this passage and directs that OPM
provide the Committees on Appropriations with a report stating
the research project's progress, results and OPM's actions in
light of such.
Barnstable County, Massachusetts
The conferees are aware that on October 1, 2002, the
Federal Salary Council recommended that Barnstable County be
included as part of the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA-NH-ME-RI-
CT Locality Pay Area (LPA). The conferees are also aware that
the President's Pay Agent did not act on that recommendation.
The conferees direct OPM to study the impact of this decision
on recruitment and retention efforts of Federal agencies with
offices in this Locality Pay Area and provide a detailed report
to the Committees on Appropriations within 45 days after
enactment of this Act. Additionally, the conferees direct OPM
to consider the Connecticut River Valley for inclusion into the
Hartford Locality Pay Area because of the difficulties some
Federal agencies have documented in retaining and attracting
Federal employees in the Connecticut River Valley.
Official Time
The conferees are aware that the Director of OPM has
instructed departments and agencies to report on the numbers of
hours of official time used by employees to perform
representational activities and that this information was to
have been submitted to OPM by October 31, 2002. The conferees
direct OPM to provide a report on official time to the
Committees on Appropriations no later than June 1, 2003.
Office of Inspector General
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF TRUST FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $1,519,000 instead of
$1,498,000 as proposed by the House and the Senate. This
includes $21,000 to fully fund fiscal year 2003 operations.
Office of Special Counsel

The conferees agree to provide $12,449,000 instead of
$12,432,000 as proposed by the House and $12,434,000 as
proposed by the Senate. This includes $15,000 to fully fund
fiscal year 2003 operations.

DIVISION K
Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent
Agencies Appropriations
The language and allocations set forth in House Report
107-740 and the Senate explanatory statement as delineated in
the Congressional Record of January 15, 2003, pages S356
through S410 should be complied with unless specifically
addressed to the contrary in the conference report and
statement of the managers. Report language included by the
House which is not changed by the report of the Senate or the
conference and Senate report language which is not changed by
the conference is approved by the committee of the conference.
The statement of the managers, while repeating some report
language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language
referred to above unless expressly provided herein. In cases
which the House or Senate have directed the submission of a
report, such report is to be submitted to both House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations.
Operating Plan and Reprogramming Procedures
The conferees continue to have a particular interest in
being informed of reprogrammings which, although they may not
change either the total amount available in an account or any
of the purposes for which the appropriation is legally
available, represent a significant departure from budget plans
presented to the Committees in an agency's budget
justifications, the basis of this appropriations Act.
Consequently, the conferees direct the Departments,
agencies, boards, commissions, corporations and offices funded
at or in excess of $100,000,000 in this bill, to consult with
the Committee on Appropriations in both the House and Senate
prior to each change from the approved budget levels in excess
of $500,000 between programs, activities, object
classifications or elements unless otherwise provided for in
the statement of the managers accompanying this Act. For
agencies, boards, commissions, corporations and offices funded
at less than $100,000,000 in this bill, the reprogramming
threshold shall be $250,000 between programs, activities,
object classifications or elements unless otherwise provided
for in the statement of the managers accompanying this Act.
Additionally, the conferees expect the Committees on
Appropriations to be promptly notified of all reprogramming
actions which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts. If
such actions would have the effect of significantly changing an
agency's funding requirements in future years, or if programs
or projects specifically cited in the statement of the managers
or accompanying reports of the House and Senate are affected by
the reprogramming, the reprogramming must be approved by the
Committees on Appropriations regardless of the amount proposed
to be moved. Furthermore, the conferees direct that the
Committees on Appropriations be consulted regarding
reorganizations of offices, programs, and activities prior to
the planned implementation of such reorganizations.
The conferees also direct that the Departments of
Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, as well as
the Corporation for National and Community Service, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, and the Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board shall submit operating plans, signed by the
respective secretary, administrator, or agency head, for review
by the Committees on Appropriations of both the House and
Senate within 60 days of the bill's enactment. Other agencies
within this Act should continue to submit operating plans
consistent with prior year policy, or as directed in this
statement of the managers.
The conferees reiterate language proposed by the House
regarding the Committees' longstanding position that while the
Committees reserve the right to call upon all offices in the
departments, agencies, boards, and commissions, access to the
budget offices is essential.
TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Of the amounts approved in the appropriations accounts in
this title, the Department must limit transfers of funds
between objectives to not more than $500,000, except as
specifically noted, without prior approval of the Committees.
No changes may be made to any account or objective, except as
approved by the Committees, if it is construed to be policy or
change in policy. Any activity or program cited in the
statement of the managers shall be construed as the position of
the conferees and should not be subject to reductions or
reprogramming without prior approval of the Committees. It is
the intent of the conferees that all carryover funds in the
various appropriations accounts are subject to the normal
reprogramming requirements outlined above. The Department is
expected to comply with all normal rules and regulations in
carrying out these directives. Finally, the Department should
continue to notify the Committees regarding reorganizations of
offices, programs, or activities prior to the planned
implementation of such reorganizations.

Deletes the reporting requirement regarding the
continuation of the vendee loan program as proposed by the
House.

by both the House and the Senate, plus $289,000 to be

Appropriates $558,000 for administrative expenses of the

to and merged with general operating expenses as proposed by
both the House and the Senate. Retains the loan limitation of
$5,000,000 for the program as proposed by the House.
GUARANTEED TRANSITIONAL HOUSING LOANS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS
PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Provides up to $750,000 of the funds available in medical
care and general operating expenses to carry out the guaranteed
transitional housing loans for homeless veterans program as
proposed by both the House and the Senate. Retains the

as proposed by the House with a new reporting date of June 2,
2003.
Veterans Health Administration
MEDICAL CARE
Appropriates $23,889,304,000 for medical care as proposed
by both the House and the Senate.
Deletes bill language proposed by the House and the
Senate delaying the availability of funds for equipment and
land and structures until August 1, 2002 remaining available
until September 30, 2003.
Retains bill language making $900,000,000 available until

authority to establish a true priority system for veterans
seeking medical care as proposed by the Senate. The House did

Retains the reporting requirement proposed by the Senate
regarding submission of the final report of the White House
Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy.
Retains language proposed by the Senate regarding the
need for an independent property appraisal of the Lakeside VAMC
facility. The establishment of community based outpatient
clinics in Wisconsin and Illinois, and the rehabilitation and
expansion of the West Side VAMC campus would be greatly
enhanced by a fair market disposition of Lakeside and the
conferees urge the VA to move forward expeditiously with the
VISN 12 CARES implementation.
The conferees are concerned that the VA is attempting to
expand its activities in the name of homeland security. The
Committees on Appropriations in both the House and the Senate
are working to ensure programs and resources are available for
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to fulfill its
mission, for individual agencies to protect their own workforce
and patrons, and still avoid redundancy in spending and effort.
The funds provided to the VA are meant to deliver quality care
and services to our Nation's veterans and their families and
the conferees expect this to be VA's primary mission.
Coordination and implementation of the Nation's homeland
security is the responsibility of the DHS, and the conferees
trust that DHS will inform the Committees if funds and
directives are needed to involve VA in additional duties for
security. To this end, the conferees direct that no more than
$110,000,000 shall be available in medical care or the medical
care collections fund for security training and equipment.
MEDICAL CARE COLLECTIONS FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Retains bill language transferring receipts from the
collections fund to medical care as proposed by both the House
and the Senate.
The conferees remain concerned with VA's continued
lackluster performance in the collection of third party
receipts and direct the VA to decline performance awards for
facility directors and collection teams which do not meet a 60-
day billing time for third-party billing or cut the third-party
billing time in half.
Retains report language regarding the billing
demonstration at a level of not less than $3,000,000 as
proposed by the House. The conferees direct quarterly reports
on the status of the billing demonstration project beginning on
March 3, 2003.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $400,000,000 for medical and prosthetic
research as proposed by the Senate instead of $405,000,000 as
proposed by the House. Retains bill language transferring
$5,000,000 to medical care for research oversight activities as
proposed by the House. The Senate did not include a similar
provision.
The conferees direct the continued partnership with the
National Technology Transfer Center at the current level of
effort.
MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION AND MISCELLANEOUS OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriates $74,716,000 for medical administration and
miscellaneous operating expenses as proposed by the House
instead of $69,716,000 as proposed by the Senate. Provides
$3,000,000 of the funds for two-year obligation instead of
$3,861,000 as proposed by the Senate and one-year availability
for all funds as proposed by the House.
Departmental Administration
GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriates $1,254,000,000 for general operating
expenses instead of $1,251,418,000 as proposed by the House and
$1,256,418,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Provides $66,000,000 to be available for two-year
obligation instead of $60,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$65,800,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Provides not less than $992,100,000 for the Veterans
Benefits Administration (VBA) as proposed by the House. The
Senate specified $992,000,000 in report language for VBA.
The conferees direct that the Offices of the Board of
Contract Appeals and Board of Veterans Appeals, and the Offices
of Assistant Secretaries for Management, Information
Technology, Human Resources, and Policy and Planning be funded
at not less than the budget request minus the proposed accrual
benefit transfer. The conferees have not provided funds for a
new Assistant Secretary of Operations, Security and
Preparedness, and maintain that coordination of the
Department's programs in this area can be accomplished by a
director under the Office of the Secretary, and implementation
of the Department's plan can be executed by the existing
undersecretaries.
Retains language proposed by the House designating
$100,000 of the funds provided to VBA for a position
description evaluation conducted by the Office of Personnel
Management.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
Appropriates $133,149,000 for the National Cemetery
Administration as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Provides $6,000,000 of the funds are available for two-year
obligation instead of $6,912,000 as proposed by the Senate and

The conferees direct VA to use the criteria and findings
of the National Shrine Study when planning and budgeting for
new and expanded cemetery projects.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $58,000,000 for the Office of Inspector
General instead of $61,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$55,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The funds are available
for two-year obligation as proposed by the Senate, instead of
one-year availability as proposed by the House.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
Appropriates $99,777,000 for construction, major projects
instead of $193,740,000 as proposed by the House and
$144,790,000 as proposed by the Senate. Regrettably, under the
stringent budget conditions the conferees have agreed not to
provide funding for the four proposed seismic projects, but
note the absence of final authorization as required by law or a
completed CARES study for any of the proposed projects. The
conferees are extremely concerned about the safety of VA
employees and patients. The conferees strongly urge the
Secretary to complete expeditiously the CARES reviews, consider
safety improvements and seismic retrofit needs when evaluating
capital assets under CARES, and factor safety concerns when
establishing the priority list of construction projects under
the CARES realignment. Further, the conferees urge the
authorizing committees to act quickly, and without prejudice,
when authorizing the CARES construction projects proposed by
the Secretary and the CARES Commission.
The conferees remain concerned about the criteria used by
the Department and the Capital Improvement Board in that the
construction projects put forth in the budget requests do not
necessarily reflect the true priorities or initiatives of the
Department. The conferees direct the Department to establish a
5-year strategic plan for capital asset management,
construction and improvement of all VA's infrastructure needs
including, but not limited to, major construction, minor
construction, research facilities, safety and seismic
improvements, and improved access to veterans. The Department
shall submit a description of the priority-setting criteria and
an estimated cost by VISN by year with the plan by May 15,
2003. The conferees direct VA to submit for funding
consideration only projects which are (1) CARES approved, (2)
in the 5-year plan, (3) a top priority for the VISN, (4)
preliminary design complete, and (5) authorized prior to
completion of the annual appropriations Act. With the
submission of the 5-year plan, the conferees delete the
direction proposed by the House regarding full funding of any
announced CARES decision.
Amends the reporting requirement regarding the evaluation
criteria used to prioritize CARES improvement projects with a
new reporting date of June 2, 2003.
CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS
Appropriates $226,000,000 for construction, minor
projects instead of $240,700,000 as proposed by the House and
$210,700,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees strongly
urge the Department to give more consideration and a greater
percentage of available funds for quality and safety
improvements to research facilities.
Retains language proposed by the House directing projects
to be consistent with CARES initiatives and national cemetery
studies. The conferees direct reporting on all minor
construction projects for fiscal year 2003 by network, region
and office due with the Operating Plan.
Of funds provided over the budget request, the conferees
direct $2,000,000 for water utility improvements at the Bay
Pines National Cemetery, as cited in the National Shrine
Commitment nation-wide study.
The conferees encourage improving entrance accessibility
at the Syracuse VAMC.
PARKING REVOLVING FUND
Allows for receipts from the parking revolving fund to be
available for obligation as proposed by both the House and the
Senate.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES
Appropriates $100,000,000 for grants for construction of
state extended care facilities as proposed by both the House
and the Senate.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE VETERANS CEMETERIES
Appropriates $32,000,000 for grants for construction of
state veterans cemeteries as proposed by both the House and the
Senate.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Retains twelve administrative provisions proposed by both
the House and the Senate, eleven of which were included in the
fiscal year 2002 bill.
Retains language proposed by the House and the Senate
eliminating the health services improvement fund, depositing
all receipts in the medical care collections fund, and
permanently extending the Department's authority to collect
prescription co-payments.
Retains language proposed by the House allowing the
Department to reimburse from fiscal year 2003 salary and
expenses accounts for services rendered to the Office of
Resolution Management up to $29,318,000 and the Office of
Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication up to
$3,010,000. The Senate proposed a similar provision with
technical differences.
Retains language proposed by the House limiting funds for
medical treatment of non-service connected veterans to those
who have provided accurate insurance and annual income
information.
Deletes language proposed by the House delaying the
implementation of the geographic means test for one year.
Deletes language proposed by the House prohibiting funds
in the Act to be used to adjudicate claims arising from new
concurrent receipt legislation. The conferees note that the
Veterans Benefits Administration will be able to handle the
claims caseload within the proposed funding level.
Retains language proposed by the House providing
$19,900,000 of VA's total information technology budget for
enterprise architecture activities under the Office of the
Chief Information Officer.
Amends language proposed by the House regarding
implementation of Public Law 107-287 by prohibiting funds for
implementation of section 2 and section 5.
Deletes language proposed by the House limiting funds in
medical care and the medical care collections fund for security
training and equipment to $110,000,000. Directive report
language is instead included under medical care.
Adds language exempting funds provided in medical care
from the across-the-board rescission in Division N.
TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
The conferees restate the reprogramming requirements with
respect to amounts approved for each appropriations account
within this title. The Department must limit the reprogramming
of funds between the programs, projects, and activities within
each account to not more than $500,000 without prior approval
of the Committees on Appropriations. Unless otherwise
identified in this statement of managers or committee reports,
the most detailed allocation of funds presented in the budget
justifications shall be considered to be approved, with any
deviation from such approved allocation subject to the normal
reprogramming requirements outlined above. Further, it is the
intent of the conferees that all carryover funds in the various
accounts, including recaptures and deobligations, are subject
to the normal reprogramming requirements outlined above.
Further, no changes may be made to any program, project, or
activity if it is construed to be policy or a change in policy,
without prior approval of the Committees. Finally, the
conferees expect to be notified regarding reorganizations of
offices, programs or activities prior to the planned
implementation of such reorganizations, as well as be notified,
on a monthly basis, of all ongoing litigation, including any
negotiations or discussions, planned or ongoing, regarding a
consent decree between the Department and any other entity.
Public and Indian Housing
HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $17,223,566,000 instead of $16,586,987,000
as proposed by the House and $16,928,697,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The conference agreement does not include language
proposed by the Senate to fund a portion of the section 8
voucher program through an indefinite appropriation.
The conference agreement provides a total of
$12,335,932,000 for section 8 voucher renewal costs, instead of
$11,751,000,000 as proposed by the House, $12,076,210,908 as
proposed by the Senate, and $12,526,402,608 requested in the
budget submission. The amount included assumes a 94 percent
lease-up rate of the total number of authorized vouchers,
adjusted to reflect an estimated national average cost of
$6,372 per unit instead of the $6,005 per unit cost assumed in
the budget request and assumed by the House and the Senate. The
conference agreement includes language, modified from language
proposed by the House, to fund section 8 vouchers in a manner
that more closely reflects the actual funding requirements of
the section 8 voucher program. This approach adopted by the
conferees is designed to avoid the appropriation of funds in
excess of actual requirements that in previous years has
resulted in recaptures of funds in excess of $1,000,000,000
(and often substantially more) annually while still including
sufficient flexibility to ensure that those PHAs that are able
to increase their voucher usage are provided the necessary
funds to assist additional families, up to their authorized
level. The conferees strongly encourage PHAs that are currently
below their authorized voucher level to continue to make
efforts to increase the number of families assisted with
section 8 vouchers.
Further, the conferees direct the Department to ensure
that sufficient staffing and information technology resources
are provided in fiscal year 2003 to ensure that the changes
made to the section 8 program are fully implemented.
In lieu of any direction included in the House and Senate
reports, the Department is directed to use the guidance set
forth below in administering the programs under this account in
fiscal year 2003.
The conference agreement includes language to allocate
funds among the various activities as proposed by the House.
Funds are allocated as follows:
Contract Renewals.--$15,278,370,500 for renewals of
expiring section 8 project-based assistance contracts,
amendments to section 8 project-based contracts, renewals of
expiring section 8 vouchers (including enhanced vouchers), and
for renewals of contracts entered into pursuant to the
Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act, the Low-Income
Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act, and
section 441 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.
Language is included, modified from language proposed by
the House, to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual
contributions contracts for each public housing agency based on
the total number of unit months reported under lease by the PHA
on its most recent end-of-year financial statement adjusted by
such additional timely and reliable information submitted by
the PHA to reflect the actual number of unit months under lease
at the time of contract renewal, and adjusted for local and
regional inflation factors. Language is also included, modified
from language proposed by the House, regarding the allocation
of funds to PHAs participating in the Moving to Work
demonstration. The conferees note that the amounts provided for
fiscal year 2003 renewals have been increased to reflect the
most recent estimate of a national average per-unit cost (PUC)
of $6,372, instead of the $6,005 PUC assumed in the budget
submission.
Language is included prohibiting funds made available for
contract renewals from being provided to a PHA to fund a total
number of units under lease in excess of such PHA's authorized
level of units. However, the conferees encourage PHAs to use
the flexibilities provided in this Act to continue to increase
the number of families assisted up to their authorized level.
Consistent with the manner in which section 8 project-
based administrative costs are funded, the conference agreement
includes funds for administrative expenses for the section 8
voucher program separately as proposed by the House, instead of
including funds for this purpose within the amount provided for
section 8 vouchers renewals as proposed by the Senate. Amounts
provided for renewals are only to be used for rental subsidy
costs.
Language is not included directing the Secretary to enter
into contracts to renew 2,077,336 vouchers as proposed by the
Senate. The House did not include a similar provision.
Central Reserve Fund.--$391,922,000 for a central reserve
fund to be allocated by the Secretary for amendments to section
8 annual contributions contracts. Language is included,
modified from language proposed by the House, allowing the
Secretary to use amounts made available in such fund to address
significant increases in per unit costs for vouchers and for
costs associated with increases in the number of vouchers under
lease as compared to the number of vouchers under lease at the
time of the PHA's contract renewal. The conference agreement
requires that PHAs use a portion of their program reserves for
these purposes prior to requesting funds from the central fund
to replenish such reserves. A total of $938,000,000 is
available in fiscal year 2003 in program reserve accounts
derived from amounts provided from other sources. The conferees
note that each PHA is provided an 8 percent program reserve
account at the beginning of each year, which is an additional
one-month's worth of funding in addition to estimated actual
requirements, to address any increased per unit costs and to
allow a PHA to increase their voucher usage up to their
authorized level. The conference agreement reflects the most
current per unit cost data, and provides additional funds for
vouchers over the amounts proposed by both the House and Senate
to accommodate this known increased cost. Therefore, the
conferees strongly encourage those PHAs that are below their
total authorized voucher level to use amounts available in
their program reserve accounts to make every effort to increase
their voucher lease-up rate. To facilitate that effort,
language is included requiring the Secretary to make the
necessary amounts available from the central fund to any PHA
that has obligated the amounts it has been provided for
contract renewals and has expended fifty percent of the amounts
available in its program reserve account. Once these
requirements are met, the Secretary is required to replenish
such reserves as necessary within thirty days of a request from
such agency.
Modified language is included, similar to language
proposed by the House, requiring the Secretary to submit
quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations on the
obligation of funds provided in this paragraph. Such report
shall include, at a minimum, the following: the amounts made
available from the central fund provided to replenish program
reserves which are held by PHAs, delineated by PHA; the purpose
forwhich the funds were provided; and the total balance
remaining in the fund. The first such report is due no later than July
31, 2003.
Funds provided in the central fund are only to be used
for rental subsidies. Funding for administrative expenses is
provided separately under this account.
Language is included prohibiting funds made available in
the central fund from being used to support a total number of
units under lease in excess of a PHA's authorized level of
units.
Language is not included to allow the central fund to be
used to provide additional incremental vouchers to high
performing public housing agencies as proposed by the House.
The Senate did not include similar language.
Language is not included to allow the central fund to be
used to reallocate vouchers among public housing agencies as
proposed by the Senate. The House did not include similar
language. In addition, the conference agreement does not
include language requiring the reallocation of vouchers among
public housing agencies as proposed by the Senate. The House
did not include a similar provision.
Language is not included to provide an indefinite
appropriation for the Section 8 voucher program to make
additional funds from the Treasury available should amounts
appropriated be insufficient. The House did not include a
similar provision.
Tenant Protection.--$234,016,500 for rental subsidies for
tenant protection activities to replace project-based section 8
assistance with section 8 vouchers, for conversion of section
202 and section 23 projects to section 8 assistance, for the
family reunification program, and for the witness protection
program.
Funds included for tenant protection are only to be used
for rental subsidies since funds for administrative expenses
are provided separately under this account.
Family Self Sufficiency Coordinators.--$48,000,000 for
service coordinator staff in each public housing agency,
instead of $46,000,000 as proposed by the House. The Senate did
not allocate a specific amount for this purpose.
Administrative Costs--Section 8 Voucher Program.--Not to
exceed $1,072,257,000 for PHA administrative costs and other
expenses, of which $69,547,000 is for associated administrative
expenses related to new tenant protection vouchers and
additional vouchers supported from the central fund. The House
proposed a total of $1,177,000,000 for this purpose, including
$50,000,000 for new vouchers. The Senate did not allocate a
specific amount for this purpose.
Language is included determining the distribution of
funds provided as authorized under section 8(q) of the United
States Housing Act of 1937, as in effect immediately before the
enactment of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of
1998 as proposed by the Senate. Language is not included
limiting administrative fees and other expenses to no more than
10 percent of the rental subsidy paid and requiring
administrative fee reserve balances to be used exclusively to
support the section 8 program as proposed by the House. The
conferees remain concerned that many PHAs have accumulated
significant excess balances in reserve accounts from unspent
section 8 administrative fees. Language is included prohibiting
fiscal year 2003 fee payments from being made to any PHA unless
such PHA reports to the Secretary on the amounts remaining in
their administrative fee reserve account as of January 31,
2003. Language is also included reducing fiscal year 2003 fee
payments to any PHA by any such amounts remaining available in
such PHA's administrative fee reserves which exceed 105 percent
of the amount of fees paid to such agency in fiscal year 2002,
but exempts those PHAs whose fiscal year 2003 payments will not
exceed $100,000. Language is also included requiring the
Secretary to recapture any fiscal year 2003 funds provided to a
PHA which are in excess of the amounts expended by such PHA for
the section 8 voucher program and that are not otherwise needed
to maintain an administrative fee reserve account balance of
not to exceed five percent. Modified language is also included,
similar to language proposed by the House, requiring the
Secretary to provide a report to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than July 1, 2003 on the administrative
costs and other expenses associated with the section 8 voucher
program. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the
following: the total amount of administrative fees paid
compared to the actual amount of fees expended to administer
the section 8 voucher program in fiscal year 2002; the total
amount of administrative fee reserve funds used in fiscal year
2002 by PHAs to support non-section 8 voucher programs, and the
purposes for which the funds were used; a comparison of the
administrative fee structure used for the section 8 voucher
program as compared to the project-based subsidy program; and
recommendations for changes to the section 8 voucher program
administrative fee structure to better align fees with actual
costs. The conferees agree that the Committees on
Appropriations will take the results of this study into
consideration when making future funding decisions, including
the appropriate level of administrative fee reserves. The
Senate did not propose similar language.
Administrative Costs--Project-Based Section 8 Program.--
$196,000,000 for contractors to administer the project-based
section 8 program, the same amount proposed by the House and
Senate.
Working Capital Fund.--Not less than $3,000,000 for
transfer to the Working Capital Fund for the development of and
modifications to information technology systems as proposed by
both the House and the Senate.
Includes new language allowing the Secretary to transfer
up to 15 percent of the funds provided for contract renewals,
the central fund and administrative fees between such
activities under certain circumstances and in accordance with
certain procedures. Language is also included under
Administrative Provisions in this title to provide the
Secretary with flexibility in applying any across-the-board
rescission mandated elsewhere in this Act to funds provided in
this account. The conferees have included this flexibility to
ensure that any such reduction does not result in a decrease in
the number of families that are currently being assisted
through the section 8 voucher program.
Includes language permanently requiring all PHAs to
submit accounting data for funds provided under this account in
this Act or any other Act by source of funds and purpose of
such funds as proposed by the House. The Senate did not include
similar language.
The conference agreement does not include $36,000,000 for
incremental vouchers for disabled families as proposed by the
House. The Senate did not include similar language. However,
modified language is included, similar to language proposed by
the Senate, to ensure that PHAs continue to make available
vouchers previously provided for non-elderly disabled families
to other non-elderly disabled families upon turnover. The House
did not include similar language. The conferees direct the
Department to review the effectiveness of section 8 vouchers in
meeting the housing needs of persons with disabilities and
report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its findings
no later than August 15, 2003.
Includes language rescinding $1,600,000,000 from
unobligated balances of funds appropriated in fiscal year 2002
and prior years, instead of $1,300,000,000 as proposed by the
House and $1,400,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Includes
language allowing unobligated balances in programs governed by
reallocation provisions to be used to meet this rescission as
proposed by the Senate. The House did not include similar
language. Modified language, similar to language proposed by
both the House and the Senate, is included to cancel balances
from certain terminated contracts.
Language is not included requiring that amounts made
available for welfare-to-work vouchers remain available in
subsequent fiscal years exclusively for such families upon
voucher turnover or renewal as proposed by the Senate. The
House did not include similar language.
The conferees direct the Department to submit quarterly
reports on the project-based section 8 program to the
Committees on Appropriations which identify the number of units
and properties for which owners have elected to opt-out of the
project-based section 8 program or pre-pay mortgages on
federally-assisted properties, and the repair needs of units
remaining in the project-based section 8 program.
PUBLIC HOUSING CAPITAL FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $2,730,000,000 for the public housing
capital fund instead of $2,683,400,000 as proposed by the
Senate and $2,843,400,000 as proposed by the House.
Includes modified language, similar to language proposed
by the House, designating $447,000,000 to be allocated only to
those PHAs which utilized their funds in compliance with the
statutory timeliness requirements pursuant to the Quality
Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA). The
additional funds are to enable those PHAs to address their
backlog of maintenance needs in addition to their annual
maintenance requirements. The Senate did not include similar
language.
Does not include language proposed by the Senate
restating the applicability of the QHWRA timeliness
requirements to fiscal year 1999 funds. The House did not
propose a similar provision. The conferees note that this
language was made permanent in the fiscal year 2002
appropriations Act.
The conferees continue to be concerned that the
Department has failed to issue regulations to implement the
statutory timeliness requirements of QHWRA more than four years
after enactment of the statute. Until such time as final
regulations are implemented, the conferees have continued the
interim measures included in the fiscal year 2002 Act as a
mechanism to ensure that those PHAs which have demonstrated
their ability to use capital funds in a timely manner receive
additional funds for their backlog maintenance needs. The
conference agreement includes language, similar to language
proposed by the House, directing the Secretary to issue final
regulations implementing the timeliness requirements of QHWRA
no later than August 1, 2003.
Includes modified language, similar to language proposed
by the House and Senate, reallocating recaptured funds to PHAs
designated as high-performing agencies.
Includes $51,000,000 for technical assistance, including
up to $11,000,000 for remediation services to certain troubled
PHAs as proposed by the House, instead of $54,000,000 for
technical assistance, including up to $13,000,000 for
remediation services as proposed by the Senate.
Includes no less than $18,600,000 for information
technology systems and up to $500,000 for section 23 projects
as proposed by the House. The Senate did not include similar
language.
Includes up to $50,000,000 for emergency capital needs
resulting from emergencies or natural disasters instead of up
to $75,000,000 as proposed by the House and Senate. The
conferees recognize the importance of emergency funds but note
that given the historic use of such funds, $50,000,000 is ample
to cover emergency activities for the remainder of fiscal year
2003.
The conference agreement does not include $100,000,000
for a new loan financing program of public housing associated
with authorization legislation included as an administrative
provision in this title as proposed by the Senate. However, the
conferees are interested in exploring additional mechanisms to
leverage private sector financing for improvements in public
housing. The conferees further understand that some PHAs have
used existing statutory authorities to successfully pursue
private financing for such purposes. The conferees direct that
the Department provide a report to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than August 7, 2003, on those PHAs that
have entered into private financing partnerships for capital
modernization needs, and the results of those partnerships.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
House report regarding quarterly reports on the obligation and
expenditure of capital funds.
PUBLIC HOUSING OPERATING FUND
Appropriates $3,600,000,000 for the public housing
operating fund as proposed by the House instead of
$3,530,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Language is not included making funds available for two
years as proposed by the Senate. The House did not include a
similar provision.
Modified language is included, similar to language
proposed by the Senate, providing up to $250,000,000 from
amounts provided to make additional fiscal year 2002 operating
subsidy payments to those fourth quarter PHAs that did not
receive the same level of operating assistance provided to all
other PHAs. The conferees are disappointed with HUD's failure
to fund the fiscal year 2002 operating subsidy payments for
PHAs within the level appropriated for such purpose in fiscal
year 2002. The conferees believe that HUD's repeated practice
of using a portion of the funds appropriated for current year
operating subsidy payments to augment the amount of prior year
operating subsidy payments above the level appropriated is, at
a minimum, inappropriate, and question whether such practice is
in violation of appropriations law. The conferees note that
this inappropriate practice has resulted in operating subsidy
payments being made to PHAs at a level in excess of the amounts
provided for such purpose in the appropriations Act. Therefore,
the conference agreement includes language, similar to language
proposed by the Senate, prohibiting funds provided for
operating subsidies in fiscal year 2004 and subsequent fiscal
years from being used to supplement fiscal year 2003 operating
subsidy payments. The conferees reiterate the direction
included in the Senate report requiring HUD to fund fiscal year
2003 operating subsidy payments solely from fiscal year 2003
funds. Further, the conferees expect the Department to have in
place the necessary systems to accurately account for
expenditures of operating subsidy funds.
The conferees note that, in the fiscal year 2000
appropriations Act, the Committees on Appropriations
commissioned the Harvard University Graduate School of Design
to conduct a study on the costs incurred to operate well-run
public housing that was to then be used to inform the
development of a final rule for the operating subsidy formula.
The conferees understand that the final draft cost study report
has recently been released and includes a number of
recommendations that would result in adjustments to the
operating subsidy formula to make it reflect more accurately
the costs of operating well-run public housing. The
recommendations indicated that PHAs can make a number of
reforms consistent with the management of Federally-subsidized
private and non-profit multifamily housing that would result in
management and cost efficiencies in public housing. The
conferees expect PHAs to adopt such practices and efficiencies,
as appropriate. The conferees expect the Department to use the
results and recommendations of the study as it develops a final
rule for the operating subsidy formula, as directed in the
fiscal year 2000 appropriations Act. Further, the conferees
direct the Department to report to the Committees on
Appropriations, no later than May 15, 2003, on the timeline for
publishing a final operating subsidy rule and the Department's
plans for using the recommendations of the cost study in the
development of the final rule.
The conferees direct the Department to report to the
Committees no later than August 20, 2003, on the extent to
which public housing agencies have used capital funds to
subsidize operating expenses and the impact of such use on
critical housing rehabilitation needs. Such report should
include a review of individual PHAs.
REVITALIZATION OF SEVERELY DISTRESSED PUBLIC HOUSING (HOPE VI)
Appropriates $574,000,000 for the revitalization of
severely distressed public housing program (HOPE VI) as
proposed by the House and the Senate.
NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $649,000,000 as proposed by the House
instead of $648,570,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the total
amount, $4,000,000 is for inspections, training, and technical
assistance instead of $3,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Language is not included allowing the Secretary to
provide technical and financial assistance for problems
associated with mold as proposed by the Senate. The House did
not include a similar provision. The conferees understand that
such language is unnecessary since the current statutory
authorities allow the Secretary to provide such assistance. The
conferees direct the Secretary to continue to provide such
assistance as authorized under the existing statute.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
Senate report regarding the use of qualified Native-owned firms
in the design and construction of Indian housing.
INDIAN HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $5,300,000 for guaranteed loans for Native
American housing on trust lands as proposed by the House
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Of the total amount, $100,000 is for the Indian Land
Title Report Commission as proposed by the House. The Senate
did not propose similar language.
NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $1,035,000 for guaranteed loans for Native
Hawaiian housing as proposed by the House instead of $1,000,000
as proposed by the Senate.
Community Planning and Development
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS
Appropriates $292,000,000 for housing opportunities for
persons with AIDS (HOPWA) as proposed by both the House and the
Senate.
In lieu of the language included in the Senate report,
the Department is directed to renew all expiring HOPWA
contracts for permanent supportive housing funded under the
non-formula component of the HOPWA program to the extent that
such projects meet all other program requirements consistent
with the language included in the conference agreement.
RURAL HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Appropriates $25,000,000 for rural housing and economic
development as proposed by both the House and Senate. Language
is included requiring funds to be awarded by June 1, 2003 as
proposed by the House instead of June 1, 2004 as proposed by
the Senate.
EMPOWERMENT ZONES/ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES
Appropriates $30,000,000 for grants to the second round
of empowerment zones as proposed by both the House and Senate.
Language is included making funds available for obligation for
three years as proposed by the House, instead of no-year
authority as proposed by the Senate.
Language is not included making the expenditure of funds
in future years contingent upon the enactment of tax
legislation as proposed by the Senate. The House did not
include similar language. The conferees continue to maintain
that this program should be treated as a mandatory program
consistent with the Round I empowerment zones, rather than as a
discretionary program.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $4,937,000,000 for various activities funded
in this account, instead of $5,000,000,000 as proposed by the
House and the Senate. The conferees agree to the following:
$4,367,930,000 for formula grants under the Community
Development Block Grant program (CDBG), instead of
$4,577,000,000 as proposed by the House and $4,580,200,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The amount provided represents an
increase of $26,930,000 above the fiscal year 2002 level;
$71,000,000 for grants to Indian tribes instead of
$70,000,000 as proposed by the House and $72,500,000 as
proposed by the Senate;
$3,300,000 for the Housing Assistance Council as proposed
by the House and the Senate;
$2,400,000 for the National American Indian Housing
Council instead of $2,200,000 as proposed by the House and
$2,600,000 as proposed by the Senate;
$49,100,000 for section 107 grants, instead of
$33,500,000 as proposed by the House and $45,500,000 as
proposed by the Senate. Within the amount provided for section
107 grants, the conference agreement provides the following
earmarks:
$7,000,000 for insular areas;
$10,000,000 for historically black colleges and
universities. The conferees expect that up to
$2,000,000 of these funds will be used to provide
technical assistance to ensure that the intended
recipients can utilize more fully the funds provided;
$3,000,000 for community development work study;
$6,500,000 for Hispanic serving institutions;
$7,000,000 for the Community Outreach Partnerships
program;
$3,000,000 for tribal colleges and universities;
$3,000,000 for Alaska Native-Serving Institutions
and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions; and
$9,600,000 for assistance under the Hawaiian
Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000. The House proposed
$9,600,000 for this activity as a separate set aside
under this account;
$5,000,000 for the National Housing Development
Corporation for continuation of its program of acquisition,
rehabilitation, and preservation of at-risk affordable housing,
including $2,000,000 for operating expenses as proposed by the
House. The Senate did not propose funding for this program;
$5,000,000 for the National Council of La Raza HOPE Fund,
of which $500,000 is for technical assistance and fund
management and $4,500,000 is for investments and financing as
proposed by the House. The Senate did not propose funding for
this program;
$9,000,000 for Neighborhood House in St. Paul, Minnesota
for construction of the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for
Community Building, instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. The House did not propose funding for this program;
$25,250,000 for grants to eligible grantees under section
11 of the Self Help Housing Opportunity Program, instead of
$28,500,000 as proposed by the House and $22,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate;
$32,500,000 for capacity building, instead of $29,500,000
as proposed by the House and $35,500,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Of this amount, $28,250,000 shall be for LISC and the
Enterprise Foundation, of which at least $5,000,000 is for
rural areas. Additionally, $4,250,000 is for Habitat for
Humanity International, instead of $4,500,000 as proposed by
the House and $4,000,000 as proposed by the Senate;
$60,000,000 for Youthbuild instead of $65,000,000 as
proposed by the House and the Senate;
$261,000,000 for economic development initiatives instead
of $144,600,000 as proposed by the House and $130,500,000 as
proposed by the Senate. In lieu of the direction included in
the House report, the conferees note that projects receiving
funds must comply with the environmental review requirements
set forth in section 305(c) of the Multifamily Housing Property
Disposition Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 3547). The conferees will
not entertain waivers of such requirements. In addition, funds
provided for projects shall not be used for reimbursement of
expenses incurred prior to the receipt of economic development
initiative funding. Modified language is included, similar to
language proposed by the House and Senate, targeting funds made
available under this program. Because of tight budget
constraints, the conferees reduced funding for these targeted
grants by 10 percent from the amounts originally proposed in
the House and Senate reports. Targeted grants shall be made as
follows:
1. $202,500 to continue the rehabilitation of the former
Alaska Pulp Company mill site in Sitka, Alaska;
2. $202,500 to the City of Craig, Alaska for construction
of a Marine Industrial Park;
3. $405,000 to the City of Petersburg, Alaska for
construction of an aquatic center;
4. $450,000 for the Mananuska-Susitna Borough for an
agricultural processing facility in Wasilla, Alaska;
5. $450,000 for Ketchikan, Alaska for the Tongass Coast
Aquarium in Ketchikan, Alaska;

The conference agreement does not include bill language
designating separate set-asides under this account for the Boys
and Girls Clubs of America and the Girl Scouts of the USA as
proposed by the Senate, and instead includes funding for these
activities under the Neighborhood Initiatives program. The
House did not propose funding for these activities.
Includes modified language making technical corrections
to certain targeted economic development initiative grants
funded under this heading in prior appropriations Acts, similar
to language proposed by the House and the Senate.
Includes language transferring no less than $3,400,000 to
the Working Capital Fund for development of and modifications
to information technology systems as proposed by the House and
the Senate.

consolidated plans.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOAN GUARANTEES PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $6,325,000 for costs associated with section
108 loan guarantees as proposed by the House instead of
$14,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. This amount, when
combined with unobligated prior year credit subsidy
appropriations and loan commitment authority, will provide a
total of $13,325,000 in credit subsidy appropriations to
support a total loan commitment level of $579,344,000.
BROWNFIELDS REDEVELOPMENT
Appropriates $25,000,000 for brownfields redevelopment as
proposed by both the House and the Senate.
The conference agreement retains language proposed by the
House to make funds available pursuant to the current statutory
authorities instead of language proposed by the Senate.
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates a total of $2,000,000,000 for this account,
instead of $2,221,040,000 as proposed by the House and
$1,950,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes $1,925,000,000 for the
HOME Investment Partnerships program, instead of $2,021,040,000
as proposed by the House and $1,950,000,000 as proposed by the
Senate. Language is included designating $40,000,000 for
housing counseling as proposed by the Senate instead of
$25,000,000 as proposed by the House. In addition, of the total
amount provided for the HOME program, $18,000,000 is for
technical assistance including $6,000,000 for qualified non-
profit intermediaries to provide technical assistance to
Community Housing and Development Organizations (CHDOs),
instead of $20,000,000 for technical assistance including
$8,000,000 for technical assistance to CHDOs as proposed by the
House. The Senate did not propose a specific amount for this
activity.
In addition, the conference agreement includes
$75,000,000 to be allocated by the Secretary to participating
jurisdictions to provide downpayment assistance to low-income
families to help them achieve homeownership.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
House report regarding the issuance of guidance regarding the
eligibility of manufactured housing under the HOME program.
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE GRANTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $1,225,000,000 for homeless assistance
grants, instead of $1,250,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$1,215,025,000 as proposed by the Senate. Includes language
requiring the renewal of all expiring shelter plus care grants
as proposed by the House instead of bill language specifying a
dollar amount for this purpose as proposed by the Senate.
However, the conferees understand that the current estimate for
shelter plus care renewals totals $193,000,000. The conferees
expect the Department to provide the full amount necessary to
fund these renewals from within the amounts provided.
Language is included as proposed by the House designating
$11,000,000 for the national homeless data analysis project and
$6,600,000 for technical assistance. The Senate bill included
language designating a total of $17,600,000 for these
activities but did not specify an amount for each purpose.
Language is not included designating $1,500,000 under
this account for the administrative needs of the Interagency
Council on the Homeless as proposed by the House. The
conference agreement includes $1,500,000 as a separate account
in title III of this Act for this purpose as proposed by the
Senate.
Language is included designating $10,000,000 for a two-
year demonstration program to fund innovative and effective
programs to address homelessness as proposed by the House. The
conferees reiterate that funds provided for this demonstration
are only to be used for the housing portion of such programs.
Grantees shall derive supportive services funds from public or
private sources other than homeless assistance grants funded
under this account. The conferees request that the Department
submit an annual report to the Committees on Appropriations on
the projects funded under this demonstration and their
outcomes, with the first such report due March 15, 2004. The
Senate did not propose funding for this activity.
In lieu of the language in the Senate report, the
conferees reiterate their support for the creation of
additional units of permanent supportive housing and concern
over the targeting of the shelter plus care program to
chronically homeless people. The conferees are concerned that
the Department is not taking the proper steps to determine the
extent to which HUD's homeless assistance programs are meeting
the needs of chronically homeless people. Therefore, HUD is
directed to begin collecting data on the percentage and number
of beds and supportive services programs that are serving
people who are chronically disabled and/or chronically
homeless.
The conferees reiterate the direction and reporting
requirement included in the Senate report regarding the
collection and analysis of data to assess the effectiveness of
the homeless system, and direct that such report also include
HUD's timeline for finalizing data requirements for the
Homeless Management Information System.
In lieu of the direction included in the Senate report
regarding the Iowa continuum of care application, the conferees
understand that the Department has addressed the Iowa
application to the extent that is legally permissible.
Housing Programs
HOUSING FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $1,033,801,000 for housing for special
populations as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,100,000,000
as proposed by the House.
Includes $783,286,000 for section 202 housing for the
elderly as proposed by the Senate instead of $790,903,000 as
proposed by the House. Of this amount, $50,000,000 is for
service coordinators and congregate services as proposed by the
House instead of $53,000,000 as proposed by the Senate; and up
to $25,000,000 is for conversion of eligible section 202
projects to assisted living instead of $30,000,000 as proposed
by the House and up to $50,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Includes $250,515,000 for section 811 housing for the
disabled as proposed by the Senate instead of $259,097,000 as
proposed by the House.
The conference agreement does not include language
proposed by the Senate to make section 202 and section 811
grant funds available for expenditure for twelve years, but
includes modified language to make funds provided under this
heading available for obligation for four years rather than
three years as proposed by the House and Senate.
The conferees are concerned by the unduly long time it
has taken in many cases to complete construction of elderly
housing units funded through the section 202 program. While the
conferees appreciate the complexities involved in housing
construction, the conferees are concerned that many of these
delays are attributable to a lack of site control and/or
sufficient planning, design and development. Therefore, the
conference agreement includes $25,000,000 for a demonstration
grant program to facilitate planning, design and development
activities for section 202 projects instead of $50,000,000 as
proposed by the House. In lieu of the direction included in the
House report regarding preference for future capital grant
awards, the conferees direct HUD to review current procedures
for making awards under the section 202 program to ensure that
those entities which can demonstrate their ability to bring
projects on-line within the existing timeframes required by
HUD, including achieving site control, are given preference
under the section 202 program.
The conference agreement includes language, modified from
language proposed by the House, requiring the Secretary to
submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than July 15, 2003 which includes the following: (1) actions
taken, or planned to be taken, by the Department to accelerate
the completion of projects funded under the section 202
program; and (2) alternative plans to restructure or otherwise
modify the current section 202 program which would result in
the completion of units and expenditure of funds in a more
timely fashion, including, but not limited to, the option to
restructure this program in a manner which tracks other
Federally funded construction programs whereby grants for
planning and design, construction, and operations are provided
for separately.
The conference agreement does not include language
proposed by the Senate authorizing the Secretary to waive any
provision of law or regulation governing the section 202 and
section 811 programs. The House did not include similar
language. Instead, the conference agreement includes modified
language limiting the Secretary's waiver authority to only
those provisions governing the terms and conditions for project
rental assistance contracts and tenant-based voucher contracts
to enable the Secretary to limit such initial contracts to no
more than a five year term.
FLEXIBLE SUBSIDY FUND
(TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Includes language regarding the transfer of excess rental
charges to this fund as proposed by the House and the Senate.
RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE
(RESCISSION)
Includes a rescission of up to $100,000,000 from
recaptured excess section 236 funds resulting from the pre-
payment of such mortgages as proposed by the House, rather than
directing the use of such excess funds to be used for a
rehabilitation grant and loan program as proposed by the
Senate.
MANUFACTURED HOUSING FEES TRUST FUND
Appropriates $13,000,000 for authorized activities from
fees collected in the fund as proposed by the House and Senate.
Federal Housing Administration
MUTUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Establishes a $165,000,000,000 limitation on single-
family loan guarantees during fiscal year 2003 as proposed by
the House instead of a limitation of $160,000,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Establishes a $100,000,000 limitation on direct loans to
nonprofits and governmental entities in connection with the
sale of HUD-owned single-family properties, instead of a
limitation of $50,000,000 as proposed by the House and a
limitation of $250,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Appropriates $347,829,000 for administrative expenses as
proposed by both the House and Senate. Of this amount,
$343,807,000 is to be transferred to the salaries and expenses
account and not to exceed $4,022,000 is to be transferred to
the Office of Inspector General as proposed by both the House
and Senate.
Appropriates $85,720,000 for administrative contract
expenses and includes language allowing up to an additional
$16,000,000 to be made available for such expenses in certain
circumstances as proposed by both the House and Senate.
Transfers no less than $21,360,000 from administrative
contract expenses under this account to the Working Capital
Fund for the development of and modifications to information
technology systems as proposed by both the House and Senate.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
Senate report regarding submission of a report to the
Committees on Appropriations on further actions which could be
taken to protect homeowners and communities experiencing high
rates of defaults and foreclosures on FHA-insured loans, and
direct that such report be provided no later than June 2, 2003.
The conferees are aware of concerns regarding the effect
the accelerated claims disposition demonstration will have in
low-income, distressed neighborhoods, and urge the Department
to take the particular needs of these communities into
consideration when implementing this demonstration. In lieu of
the language included in the Senate report regarding the
accelerated claims disposition demonstration program, the
conferees direct HUD to provide a report to the Committees on
Appropriations no later than August 1, 2003, on savings to the
FHA single-family insurance fund and, where possible, the
impact of this demonstration on the numbers of foreclosures and
re-performing loans within the demonstration, as well as the
impact of this program on such communities if such properties
are sold to investors or resold in a deteriorated condition.
GENERAL AND SPECIAL RISK PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Establishes a $23,000,000,000 limitation on multifamily
and specialized loan guarantees during fiscal year 2003 as
proposed by the House instead of a limitation of
$21,000,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Appropriates $15,000,000 for subsidy costs to support
certain multifamily and special purpose loan guarantee programs
as proposed by the House and the Senate.
The conferees understand that once the final consolidated
OIG audit on section 514 grantees is received, the Department
will make a determination whether to lift the suspension,
recapture funds spent inappropriately, or bar grantees from
receiving funds for four years, based on the OIG assessment of
the individual violations. The conferees ask the Department to
report on the status of resolution of these findings by April
15, 2003.
Government National Mortgage Association
GUARANTEES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACCOUNT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

be transferred to the salaries and expenses account as proposed
by both the House and the Senate.

RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
Appropriates $47,000,000 for research and technology as
proposed by both the House and Senate.
Includes $7,500,000 for the Partnership for Advancing
Technology in Housing (PATH) initiative, instead of $7,000,000
as proposed by the House and $8,750,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
Senate report denying demonstration authority without prior
congressional approval.
Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES
Appropriates $45,899,000 for the Fair Housing Assistance
Program (FHAP) and the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP)
as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
Office of Lead Hazard Control
LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION
Appropriates $176,000,000 for lead hazard reduction
instead of $126,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$201,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees agree to allocate funds as follows:
--$10,000,000 for Operation LEAP;
--$96,000,000 for the lead-based paint hazard control
grant program to provide assistance to State and local
governments and Native American tribes for lead-based paint
abatement in private low-income housing;
--$10,000,000 for technical assistance and support to
State and local agencies and private property owners;
--$10,000,000 for the Healthy Homes Initiative for
competitive grants for research, standards development, and
education and outreach activities to address lead-based paint
poisoning and other housing-related diseases and hazards; and
--$50,000,000 for an initiative to target lead abatement
funds to areas with the highest lead paint abatement needs.
Includes new language making available $50,000,000 on a
competitive basis to those areas with the highest lead paint
abatement needs as determined by the highest number of pre-1940
units, a disproportionately high number of documented cases of
lead-poisoned children and an applicant's demonstrated capacity
to implement successfully the proposed uses of the funds.
Language is also included requiring that not less than 90
percent of the funds made available under this initiative to be
used exclusively for abatement and interim control of lead-
based paint hazards. Language is also included requiring
recipients of funds awarded under this initiative to provide a
matching contribution of not less than 25 percent of the total
grant award. The conferees believe that communities with the
highest lead paint risk to children must employ an aggressive
approach to lead-based paint abatement, and direct that grants
made under this new initiative be not less than $2,000,000. The
conferees intend that eligible recipients of these funds will
be units of local government. In selecting recipients for
funding under this initiative, the Department shall consider
the capacity of the applicant to use the funds provided,
including the success of the applicant in using previously
provided Federal dollars for lead-based paint hazard reduction,
as well as the applicant's strategies to mobilize public and
private resources to address this problem. Grant recipients
under this initiative are expected to use funds for abatement
and hazard reduction in privately owned rental-housing units
that serve low-income families with children under the age of
six. Units treated with funds provided under this initiative
must remain available for low-income residents for at least
three years following treatment of the lead-based paint hazard.
The conferees direct the Department to submit an annual report
to the Committees on Appropriations on the effectiveness of
this program with the first such report due March 1, 2004.
Further, the conferees request that the Department review the
need for demolition grants under this initiative and provide a
report to the Committees on Appropriations by June 27, 2003.
The conferees do not intend for any action taken in this Act to
prejudice ongoing or future litigation brought against lead
pigment manufacturers. Additionally, no action taken in this
Act is intended to mitigate the responsibility of housing
owners to address the existence of lead-based paint hazards in
a timely and expeditious manner.
The conferees are aware that the Department currently
reserves approximately 80 percent of the current lead-based
paint hazard control grant program funding for allocation to
current grantees or previous grantees, with the remaining 20
percent provided for new grantees. The conferees request that
the Department evaluate this policy to ensure that such
allocation is appropriate to ensure that resources are made
available to communities with the need as well as the capacity
to use such grants. Further, the conferees urge the Department
to consider the total amount of Federal and non-Federal
resources available to address lead-based paint hazards when
allocating funds provided for the current lead-based paint
hazard control grant program. Further, the conferees expect the
Department to award all funds provided for the current lead-
based paint hazard grant program on a competitive basis and to
report to the Committees on Appropriations by April 15, 2003 on
how this requirement is being met.
Management and Administration
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $1,090,229,000 for salaries and expenses as
proposed by the House instead of $1,070,229,000 as proposed by
the Senate. Of this amount, $530,299,000 is provided as a
direct appropriation under this account as proposed by the
House instead of $510,299,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conference agreement includes language as proposed by
the House directing the Department to allocate funds provided
under this heading in the manner specified in the joint
explanatory statement of the managers accompanying this Act
unless the Committees on Appropriations are notified and
approve of any changes in the operating plan or through a
reprogramming. The conferees reiterate the direction included
in the House report regarding such operating plan and
reprogramming procedures. The following office and object
classifications are to be used as the basis of any changes in
funding distributions:
Office of Housing.......................................  $294,224,000
Office of Public and Indian Housing.....................   153,971,000
Office of Community Planning and Development............   76,174,000
Office of Policy Development and Research...............   19,147,000
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity............   59,973,000
Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control.........    2,634,000
Government National Mortgage Association................    7,233,000
Departmental Management.................................   22,344,000
Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives........    2,606,000
Office of the Chief Financial Officer...................   53,986,000
Office of the General Counsel...........................   68,336,000
Office of Field Policy and Management...................   77,410,000
Office of Administration................................   241,761,000
Transfer to the Working Capital Fund....................   10,500,000
--------------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________
Total, Management and Administration.............. $1,090,229,000
Consistent with modifications to the original budget
submission, the object classification distribution, which shall
also serve as the basis for the operating plan and
reprogramming changes, is as follows:
Personal Services--$830,763,000
Travel and Transportation of Persons--$25,508,000
Transportation of Things--$700,000
Rent, Communications and Utilities--$124,572,000
Printing and Reproduction--$4,644,000
Other Services--$97,807,000
Supplies and Materials--$4,932,000
Furniture and Equipment--$1,180,000
Indemnities--$193,000
The preceding object classification distribution includes
$20,000,000 provided for funds control improvements within the
Other Services object class. The Department is directed to
submit a spending plan allocating these funds no later than
April 15, 2003.
Allocations included in the conference agreement are
consistent with the distributions included in the Department's
budget submission, excluding amounts assumed contingent upon
enactment of legislative changes to legacy retirement costs,
updated to include the effects of the reorganization
implemented during fiscal year 2002 and additional resources
provided for funds control improvements. However, the conferees
understand recent hiring decisions have resulted in the
Department exceeding its requested 9,100 full time equivalents
(FTE) level by an estimated 268 FTEs. This increase contradicts
the Department's budget justification submission for the fiscal
year. In addition, the Committees on Appropriations were not
informed of this substantive change in staffing until the
funding shortfall caused by this FTE level reached critical
proportions. Further, the conferees understand that the
Department's hiring actions were in many cases inconsistent
with the Department's Resource Estimation and AllocationProcess
(REAP) resulting in some offices and functions remaining understaffed
while other offices and functions are overstaffed. The conferees are
disturbed by the Department's failure to adhere to staffing levels set
forth in the budget and to meet required notification requirements
regarding such changes, as well as by the Department's inability to
manage the allocation of staff resources based upon workload
requirements. Modified language is included, similar to language
proposed by the House, requiring the Secretary to submit a staffing
plan for the Department no later than March 15, 2003. In addition, the
Department is directed to submit a reprogramming of funds no later than
March 15, 2003 that reflects changes from the office and object
classification distributions included in this conference agreement, as
well as the actions the Department is taking to realign staffing
resources to match workload requirements, including any additional
staffing requirements resulting from changes made to the section 8
voucher program in this Act.
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also requested
to review the Department's hiring decisions to determine
whether these decisions have been consistent with the
Department's staffing needs, program requirements, and
applicable personnel practices. The OIG is asked to report to
the Committees on Appropriations on its findings no later than
August 15, 2003.
Language is included designating $20,000,000 to remain
available for two years for funds control improvements as
proposed by the House. The Senate bill did not include a
similar provision. Language is also included, as proposed by
the House, related to funds control improvements. The Senate
did not include similar language. The conferees reiterate the
concerns expressed in the House report regarding the severe
chronic funds control problems at the Department, including the
failure of the Department to make timely formal determinations
of the violations of Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA) and other
appropriations statutes. The conferees reiterate all direction
included in the House report regarding this problem, including
the direction included in the House report regarding the
authority and the responsibility of the Office of the Chief
Financial Officer (OCFO) with respect to compliance with
appropriations laws, including the ADA. The conferees note that
to assist the OCFO in fulfilling these responsibilities, the
conference agreement includes language establishing a division
of appropriations law within the OCFO and transferring no fewer
than four experienced appropriations attorneys from the
Legislative Division of the Office of Legislation and
Regulations, Office of the General Counsel to the OCFO for such
new division. The conferees direct that the Secretary ensure
that all attorneys transferred pursuant to the conference
agreement have significant experience and expertise in matters
of appropriations law, and further direct the Secretary to
report to the Committees on Appropriations within 15 days of
enactment of this Act on the actions taken to comply with this
requirement.
Language is included in the bill placing a limitation on
the number of GS-14 and GS-15 positions at the Department as
proposed by the House. The Senate did not include similar
language.
The conferees reiterate the direction included in the
Senate report regarding the limitation on non-career employees.
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
Appropriates $276,300,000 for the Working Capital Fund as
proposed by the House instead of $276,737,000 as proposed by
the Senate. In addition, the conference agreement includes an
additional $75,100,000 by transfer from various accounts to
support program-specific information technology systems as
proposed by the House and Senate.
Language is included prohibiting funds made available to
the Department from being used to award a new contract for the
HUD Information Technology Services project until after
submission of a comprehensive five-year plan in accordance with
the direction included in this joint statement of the managers.
The Department is directed to submit a comprehensive five-year
plan that meets all the requirements and direction included in
the House report. The Senate did not include similar language.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $97,499,000 for the Office of Inspector
General instead of $96,684,000 as proposed by the House and
$97,684,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of this amount,
$23,343,000 is provided by transfer from the various funds of
the Federal Housing Administration as proposed by the House and
the Senate.
In lieu of the direction included in the Senate report,
at least $5,000,000 is to be targeted to anti-predatory lending
and anti-flipping activities.
CONSOLIDATED FEE FUND
(RESCISSION)
Includes a rescission of $8,000,000 from the Fund as
proposed by the Senate. The House proposed similar language but
did not designate a specific dollar amount.
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $30,000,000 for the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to be derived from
collections available in the Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight Fund as proposed by the House and the Senate.
The conferees agree that OFHEO must have the necessary
staff in order to fully meet its regulatory mission. However,
previous staffing plans submitted by OFHEO have often lacked
the necessary level of detail required by the Committees on
Appropriations to accurately assess the staffing and funding
needs of the agency. The conferees expect OFHEO to provide a
detailed report to the Committees on Appropriations no later
than August 15, 2003, detailing its current staffing levels and
corresponding responsibilities, as well as whether additional
staff is required to fully meet its regulatory mission.
Administrative Provisions
Does not include language to amend section 683(2) of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1972 to authorize
service coordinators in section 811 projects as proposed by the
Senate. The House did not include similar language.
Does not include language to amend section 9 of the
United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize a new loan-
financing program for public housing authorities as proposed by

Committees on Appropriations by March 15, 2003. The Senate did
not include similar language.
Includes language repealing section 9(n)(1) of the United

the Housing Certificate Fund and should provide the most
updated information practicable.
Includes language waiving certain first-time homebuyer
requirements to allow the use of a HOPE III grant in the East
Baltimore, Maryland community as proposed by the Senate. The
House did not include similar language.

TITLE III
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
American Battle Monuments Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $35,246,000 for salaries and expenses as
proposed by the House instead of $30,400,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees have provided an additional $846,000 above
the budget request to provide salaries and benefits for up to
20 additional full time equivalent personnel where manpower
needs are evident throughout the ABMC system because of
reductions in the work week mandated by a foreign government.
In addition, $4,000,000 has been provided for additional
planning and construction costs associated with a new visitors
center at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near St.
Laurent-sur-Mer, France. In this regard, the conferees agree
that because the ABMC has begun initial planning of the project
and may soon move to design and other pre-construction
activities, a restriction on the use of funds for this project
contained in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations legislation is
withdrawn.
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Provides a total funding level of $7,850,000 as proposed
by the Senate instead of $6,500,000 as proposed by the House.
Of this amount $1,400,000 is derived from fiscal year 2002
unobligated balances. The conferees have provided $500,000 of
the amount appropriated in fiscal year 2003 to be available
through fiscal year 2004 as proposed by the Senate instead of
$2,500,000 as proposed by the House. The conferees have
included bill language again this fiscal year which limits the
number of career Senior Executive Service positions to three.
The conferees reiterate the House position regarding
reprogrammings for the Board and that the use of carryover
funds is subject to these same requirements.
Department of the Treasury
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND
PROGRAM ACCOUNT
Appropriates $75,000,000 for the Community Development
Financial Institutions Fund instead of $80,000,000 as proposed
by the House and $73,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Includes $5,000,000 for technical assistance designed to
benefit Native American communities as proposed by the Senate
instead of $2,000,000 as proposed by the House.
Provides $10,750,000 for administrative expenses as
proposed by the Senate instead of $11,050,000 as proposed by
the House.
Provides for a limitation on the amount of direct loans
of $11,000,000 as proposed by both the House and Senate.
Consumer Product Safety Commission
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $57,000,000 for the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, salaries and expenses, instead of $57,117,000 as
proposed by the House and $56,767,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
Corporation for National and Community Service
NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS OPERATING EXPENSES
(INCLUDING RESCISSION AND TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $429,000,000 for national and community
service programs operating expenses instead of $405,842,000 as
proposed by the Senate. The House provided authority for prior
year funds to be used to terminate the Corporation and did not
include any other provisions under this account.
Limits the fiscal year 2003 AmeriCorps enrollment to no
more than 50,000 new members who incur obligations from the
National Service Trust as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
were dismayed to learn of the gross financial mismanagement of
the Trust Fund and over-commitments made to various
organizations without the financial resources to support those
obligations, especially after years of providing funds for and
directing the Corporation to strengthen grant management
systems and financial controls. While the current leadership of
the Corporation is to be commended for bringing these issues to
light, the conferees maintain that the Corporation needs time
to resolve the financial weakness and oversight issues within
the organization before the program can grow. To that end, the
conferees have approached fiscal year 2003 funding for the
Corporation with two guiding principles: (1) stabilization of
the Corporation's programs and resources; and (2) maintenance
of commitments to graduates of the Corporation's programs.
Limits administrative expenses to not more than
$32,500,000, of which not more than $2,500 is for reception and
representation expenses as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees direct $18,000,000 for program administration,
$12,000,000 for Governor-appointed State Commissions on
National and Community Service, and $2,500,000 for the Office
of the Chief Financial Officer to enact financial reform in the
Corporation.
Limits $100,000,000, instead of $15,000,000 as proposed
by the Senate, to be transferred to the National Service Trust,
of which up to $5,000,000 shall be available for national
service scholarships for high school students. The conferees
did not provide funds for the Senior Service Initiative. The
conferees amend the quarterly reporting requirement as proposed
by the House and Senate regarding expenditures under the Trust
to include an additional reporting requirement of enrollment
data on the authorized and actual number of AmeriCorps members
to be submitted by March 31, 2003. The conferees further direct
the Corporation to ensure immediately that funds are available
to pay the education awards earned by program graduates before
any new members are enrolled in the Trust.
Limits $275,000,000 for subtitle C grants under the
National Service Trust of which not more than $50,000,000 may
be for national direct programs, and $100,000,000 is
transferred to the National Service Trust. Grants are to be
made according to peer review panel recommendations. The Senate
proposed limiting the subtitle C grants to $240,492,000 of
which not more than $47,000,000 could be used for national
service programs. This funding level provided will support
50,000 new volunteers enrolled in the Trust in fiscal year
2003. The conferees direct the continuation of two programs
areas to be funded in fiscal year 2003 at a level proportionate
to last year considering the funding provided in fiscal year
2003: (1) programs designed to help children read by third
grade, and (2) programs which provide information technology
skills to students and teachers in low-income communities.
Provides $10,000,000 to the Points of Light Foundation,
of which up to $2,500,000 may be used for an endowment as
proposed by the Senate.
Prohibits the use of funds for national service programs
run by other agencies and directs the Corporation to reduce the
Federal cost per participant as proposed by the Senate.
Limits funding for the National Civilian Community Corps
to $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees reduced
the funding level from the budget request without prejudice.
Limits funding for subtitle B grants for school-based and
community-based service learning programs to $43,000,000 as
proposed by the Senate.
Limits funding for subtitle H grants, innovation,
demonstration and assistance activities, to $35,500,000 instead
of $29,850,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees have
provided $500,000 for Martin Luther King Jr. Day grants,
$100,000 for the Fellowship program, $8,000,000 for training
and technical assistance, $6,000,000 for education award
grants, $5,000,000 for Promise Fellows, and $5,900,000 for
disability programs. Further, the conferees have provided
$4,000,000 for grants to encourage the next generation of
national service organizations as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees have not provided the full funding request for
recruitment activities since most of the fiscal year 2003
positions are filled, nor have the conferees provided funds for
any innovation or demonstration program utilizing vouchers. The
conferees do not recommend the request to transfer Education
Awards and Promise Fellows programs from Innovation Activities
to AmeriCorps Grants.
Provides $6,000,000 for challenge grants under subtitle H
as proposed by the Senate. The conferees amend the criteria for
challenge grants by requiring a 2-to-1 private to Federal
dollar matching requirement for grant recipients and limiting
the grants to one year in duration.
Provides $5,000,000 for America's Promise as proposed by
the Senate. The conferees amend the reporting requirement
proposed regarding funding and performance with a new reporting
date of March 31, 2003.
Limits funding for audits and evaluations to $3,000,000,
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
did not provide funding for the proposed research-based
institute in partnership with a university or non-profit
organization.
Rescinds $48,000,000 from prior year unobligated balances
identified within funds appropriated between fiscal year 1998
and fiscal year 2002 across all grant programs. None of the
rescission is derived from the National Service Trust.
The conferees remind the Corporation of the reporting and
reprogramming requirements set forth at the beginning of this
division. Various reporting requirements listed in both the
House report and the Senate record must be fulfilled with the
submission of the fiscal year 2003 operating plan unless
otherwise noted. Further, the conferees direct the Corporation
to provide better, detailed information in the budgetrequest
regarding planned and on-going activities, the costs of those
activities, and the expected results.
The conferees reiterate the directive to the Corporation
to establish performance measures for each grantee, require
each grantee to submit a correction plan should the grantee not
meet the agreed-upon measures, and reduce or terminate any
award where, after due process, the grantee does not meet the
performance plan.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $6,000,000 for Office of Inspector General
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the House and $6,900,000
as proposed by the Senate.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
Retains the administrative provisions proposed by the
Senate regarding qualified student loans eligible for education
awards and the availability of funds for the placement of
volunteers with disabilities. The House included a similar
provision regarding qualified student loans, but with technical
differences.
U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $14,326,000 for salaries and expenses as
proposed by the House instead of $14,612,000 as proposed by the
Senate.
The conferees believe all federal employees should be
safe in their work environments. The General Services
Administration (GSA) is responsible for providing security for
the Federal tenants of privately owned buildings. The conferees
strongly urge the Court, together with the other tenants of the
building, to work with GSA, in consultation with the Department
of Homeland Security, on a security plan acceptable to all
tenants, the community and the owner. The cost of the plan
should be borne equally by all tenants.
The conferees remind the Court of its obligation to
comply with the reprogramming requirements set forth at the
beginning of this division and direct the Court to submit an
operating plan to the Committees on Appropriations of both the
House and Senate 60 days after enactment of this Act.
Department of Defense--Civil
Cemeterial Expenses, Army
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $32,445,000 for salaries and expenses as
proposed by the House instead of $24,445,000 as proposed by the

Memorial Amphitheater and accelerated development of section
90.
Department of Health and Human Services
National Institutes of Health
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES
Appropriates $84,074,000 for the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences as proposed by the House instead
of $76,074,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the appropriated
amount, $48,936,000 is for research and $27,138,000 is for
worker training activities as proposed in the budget
submission.
In addition, the conferees have provided $8,000,000,
split equally between research and worker training, for NIEHS
activities related to the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001 which had been appropriated in a Supplemental
Appropriations Act but not requested by the Administration as a
contingent emergency.
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH
Appropriates $82,800,000 for toxic substances and
environmental public health instead of $88,688,000 as proposed
by the House and $81,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Of the
amount provided, $1,800,000 is intended to reimburse ATSDR for
direct and indirect costs of the Agency related to the events
of September 11, 2001.
Bill language has again this year been included which
permits the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to conduct other appropriate
health studies and evaluations or activities in lieu of health
assessments pursuant to section 104(i)(6) of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980, as amended (CERCLA). The language further stipulates that
in the conduct of such other health assessments, evaluations or
activities, the ATSDR shall not be bound by the deadlines
imposed in section 104(i)(6)(A) of CERCLA. Funds provided for
fiscal year 2003 cannot be used by the ATSDR to conduct in
excess of 40 toxicological profiles.
From within the funds provided, the conferees expect
ATSDR to establish a fish consumption advisory pilot program in
the State of Michigan, implement a multi-faceted health study
of polychlorinated biphenyl exposure in Anniston, Alabama, and
monitor and assess the long-term health status of children,
adolescents, and young adults in Herculaneum, Missouri
regarding their exposure to lead.
Finally, the conferees have again agreed to cap
administrative costs charged by the CDC at 7.5 percent of the
amount appropriated herein for the ATSDR.
Environmental Protection Agency

Appropriates $720,261,000 for science and technology
instead of $714,578,000 as proposed by the House and
$707,203,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees have
included language similar to that proposed by the House giving
EPA the ability to contract for the temporary or intermittent
services of students or recent graduates. The language, with
technical differences, is similar to language adopted in Public
Law 106-113 to provide such authority to the United States
Geological Survey.

of $5,588,000 above the fiscal year 2002 funding level.
The conference agreement provides for a general reduction
for the ``Environmental Programs and Management'' account of
$45,001,000. Further, the agreement provides for no reductions
as proposed by the House for the Management Services and
Stewardship and Planning and Resource Management activities,
and provides for no increase in the Energy Star program as

The conference agreement provides $9,160,000 from within
available funds for the continuing operation of the
Environmental Education programs. In this regard, the Agency is
directed to proportionately distribute funds for the
Environmental Education programs in a manner consistent with
the provisions of the National Environmental Education Act.
The conferees have, within available funds, provided the
fiscal year 2002 level for the eight Environmental Finance
Centers. Also within available funds, the Agency is directed to
provide $350,000 for maintenance and updating of the Cumulative
and Aggregate Risk Evaluation System software package; $250,000
to continue development of BASINS models, GIS mapping,
integration with other financial and planning tools, and
incorporation of cost-effectiveness considerations into
integrated priority ranking systems; and $200,000 for setting
standards and to increase public and government awareness of
the benefits of ambient temperature glass technology.
The Agency's budget submission for fiscal year 2003
called for a significant reduction in work conducted through
the Climate Protection/Transportation program. So that work
conducted under this program can be phased in a more
appropriate manner, the conferees direct EPA to provide no less
than $5,000,000 from within available funds for work of the
FEV/Clean Automotive Technology program on advanced hydraulic
hybrid vehicles, extremely clean diesel technologies, and
advanced gasoline engine concepts.
The conferees expect EPA to establish and implement a
Highlands Action Program (HAP) in partnership with Canaan
Valley Institute (CVI) to take action on the problems
identified in the follow-up Mid-Atlantic Highlands report that
Congress directed the EPA to prepare in the fiscal year 2002
House and Conference Reports. The HAP should, among other
things, use environmental indicators, strong science, and
partnerships to identify the causes of those problems; develop
solutions and management actions to resolve the identified
problems; and develop a management plan that includes states,
non-governmental organizations, local communities and the
private sector. The Agency is expected to periodically assess
the status of the HAP and report back to Congress on the
findings and the successes of the program.
The Agency is directed to submit as part of the fiscal
year 2003 Operations Plan a resource plan detailing the number
of pesticide tolerance reassessments and re-registrations
required under FQPA, the number and kind of such activities
completed since 1996, the status of the remaining activities,
including the projected number to be completed year-to-year
under FQPA, and the level of resources needed to meet these
requirements. Similarly, the Agency is expected to include in
its fiscal year 2003 Operations Plan a report of its actions
and accomplishments towards restoring personnel in its civil
enforcement program, as well as a report of the Agency's plan
towards aggressively filling and retaining FTE vacancies within
OECA.
Last year, the Agency was asked by the House of
Representatives' Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and
Independent Agencies to undertake an agreement with the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the current draft
Dioxin Reassessment. Among other things, the review was
intended to address the toxicological questions associated with
dioxin, including, the scientific evidence for the appropriate
classification of dioxin as to its potential human
carcinogenicity, the validity of the non-threshold linear dose-
response model in light of epidemiological studies and the
corresponding cancer slope factor calculated by the Agency
through use of this model, the scientific evidence supporting
the calculation and use of Toxicity Equivalent Factors, and the
appropriateness of including ``dioxin-like'' chemicals in the
risk assessment without individual empirical review of their
effects.
Concerns raised by other federal agencies, outside
scientists, and EPA's own Science Advisory Board as to the
scientific underpinning of the Reassessment, as well as
questions of consistency with other international assessments
of dioxin and the positions on these taken by other federal
agencies, in large part prompted this request. Because of the
enormous policy implications of this Reassessment, the Agency
in early Fall, 2002, asked for additional time to convene an
Interagency Working Group (IWG) so as to review and address
many of the toxicological questions that have been raised
concerning the dioxin reassessment, including, but not limited
to, the scientific evidence used to classify the
carcinogenicity of dioxin to humans, the Agency's use of a
linear dose-response model to estimate cancer risk levels, the
scientific support for the use of the Toxic Equivalency Factors
for dioxins, and the use of body burden as the appropriate dose
metric.
While the conferees acknowledge the complexity of this
issue, it is unclear as to how much progress has been made by
the IWG. The conferees note that a year has passed since the
Agency was first requested to pursue such a review by the
Academy. In light of this fact and so that no further delay of
this important issue occur, the conferees direct that unless
the IWG has completed its review and issued a report within 60
days of enactment of the Act, the Agency is to contract with
the Academy as quickly as possible thereafter so that the
Academy may undertake a review of the Reassessment as
originally requested. In issuing this direction, it is not the
intention of the conferees to delay the work of the IWG. In
addition, upon completion of the review by the NAS, the Agency
is expected to move expeditiously to review the Academy's
report, make any appropriate changes as necessary in the
Reassessment, and issue a final document.
The conferees are aware that EPA is currently working
with the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to develop an
environmentally acceptable program which will aid MARAD in
meeting its statutory mandate to dispose of obsolete vessels of
the National Defense Reserve Fleet, and encourage EPA to
continue its efforts to find solutions to dispose of these
ships so as to eliminate to the greatest extent possible all
potential environmental hazards.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $36,000,000 for the Office of Inspector
General instead of $35,325,000 as proposed by the House and
$37,325,000 as proposed by the Senate. In addition to amounts
appropriated directly to the OIG, $12,742,000 is also available
by transfer from funds appropriated for Hazardous Substance
Superfund.
The conferees strongly encourage the Inspector General to
prepare and submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the
House and the Senate at the earliest practical date an audit
management plan and the personnel requirements which will best
enhance the expertise and maximize the efficiencies of the
Office.
BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
Appropriates $42,918,000 for buildings and facilities as
proposed by the House and the Senate.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $1,272,888,000 for hazardous substance
superfund as proposed by the Senate instead of $1,422,888,000
as proposed by the House. Bill language provides that
$636,444,000 of the appropriated amount is to be derived from
the Superfund Trust Fund and a like amount is to be derived
from General Revenues of the Treasury. Additional language
provides for the transfer of $12,742,000 to the Office of
Inspector General, and for the transfer of $86,168,000 to the
Science and Technology account.
The conferees have agreed to the following fiscal year
2003 funding levels:
1. $856,900,000 for Superfund response and cleanup
activities.
2. $143,600,000 for enforcement activities.
3. $134,600,000 for management and support.
4. $12,742,000 for transfer to the Office of Inspector
General.
5. $86,168,000 for research and development activities,
to be transferred to the Science and Technology account.
6. $38,826,000 for reimbursable interagency activities,
including $28,150,000 for the Department of Justice and
$10,676,000 for OSHA, FEMA, NOAA, the United States Coast
Guard, and for the Department of the Interior.
The conferees remain concerned that a recent Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) entered into between the EPA and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) does not fully address all
jurisdictional concerns expressed in past years by the
Congress. The Agency is therefore once again directed to
negotiate and enter into an amended MOU which fully addresses
these remaining issues. The Agency is further directed to
report to the Committees on Appropriations by the 28th day of
each month on the progress towards completing this direction.
Once again this year, the conferees support the national
pilot worker training program which recruits and trains young
persons who live near hazardous waste sites or in communities
at risk of exposure to contaminated properties for work in the
environmental field. The conferees direct EPA to continue
funding this effort in cooperation and collaboration with the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
The conferees are aware of the Agency's ongoing program
to coordinate the clean-up of vermiculite from certain homes in
the Libby, Montana area, and are concerned with reports of both
excessive costs and schedule delays associated with the
program. The Agency should be aware of the long-standing
concerns of the Committees on Appropriations regarding the
judicious use of Superfund dollars by the EPA, and the
conferees caution the Agency to move forward with this program
in a manner which appropriately meets the needs of assistance
for individuals in Libby while remaining fiscally responsible
and containing costs in light of competing national priorities
within the Superfund program.
LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK PROGRAM
Appropriates $72,313,000 for the leaking underground
storage tank program as proposed by the House and the Senate.
OIL SPILL RESPONSE
Appropriates $15,581,000 for oil spill response as
proposed by the House and the Senate.
STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS
Appropriates $3,859,994,000 for state and tribal
assistance grants instead of $3,789,185,000 as proposed by the
House and $3,920,639,000 as proposed by the Senate. Bill
language specifically provides $1,350,000,000 for Clean Water
State Revolving Fund (SRF) capitalization grants, of which up
to $75,000,000 is to be made available for use by States that
choose to make loans, including interest-free loans, that
increase non-point and non-structural, decentralized
alternatives, thus expanding the choices available to
communities in their fight forclean water. The conferees
strongly encourage States that can do so to pursue innovative
technologies in this regard, but emphasize that this program is
voluntary and that States not participating in the program will
nevertheless continue to receive their normal level of funding through
the established SRF formulas.
Additional bill language provides $850,000,000 for Safe
Drinking Water SRF capitalization grants; $50,000,000 for the
United States-Mexico Border program; $43,000,000 for grants to
address drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs in
rural and native Alaska communities; $3,000,000 for remediation
of above ground leaking fuel tanks in Alaska pursuant to Public
Law 106-554; $8,225,000 for grants for construction of
alternative decentralized wastewater facilities; $90,500,000
for a new Brownfields grant program; $1,150,382,000 for
categorical grants to the states and tribes, including
$50,000,000 for Brownfields categorical grants and $19,999,900
for the Environmental Information Exchange program; and
$314,887,000 for cost-shared grants for construction of water
and wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure and for
groundwater protection infrastructure.
The conferees have included bill language which, for
fiscal year 2003, authorizes the Administrator of the EPA to
use funds appropriated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (FWPCA) to make grants to Indian tribes pursuant to
section 319(h) and 518(e) of FWPCA. In addition, bill language
has been adopted which, (1) will permit the states to include
as principal amounts considered to be the cost of administering
SRF loans to eligible borrowers, with certain limitations; (2)
permits the Administrator to reserve up to 1\1/2\ percent of
the funds appropriated for the SRF under title VI of the FWPCA
for grants under section 518(c) of that Act; (3) for fiscal
year 2003, authorizes the states to transfer funds between the
Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water SRF programs; and (4)
stipulates that no funds provided in the Act to address water
infrastructure needs of colonias within the United States along
the United States-Mexico border shall be made available to a
county or municipal government unless that governmental entity
has established an enforceable ordinance or rule which prevents
the development or construction of any additional colonia
areas, or the development within an existing colonia of any new
home, business, or other structure which lacks water,
wastewater, or other necessary infrastructure.
The conferees have included bill language which makes
technical corrections and changes to grants approved in
previous fiscal years. Finally, as in previous years, the
conferees have included bill language which stipulates that
none of the funds provided in this or any previous years' Acts
for the Safe Drinking Water SRF may be reserved by the
Administrator for health effects studies on drinking water
contaminants. The conferees have instead provided significant
resources for such studies within EPA's Science and Technology
account.
Of the funds provided for the United States-Mexico Border
program, $7,000,000 is for continuation of the El Paso, Texas
desalination and water supply project, and $2,000,000 is for
the Brownsville, Texas water supply project.
The conference agreement provides $8,225,000 for six
specific grants under the National Decentralized Wastewater
Demonstration program. The program, which has shown tremendous
success in developing and transferring technologies which offer
alternatives to centralized wastewater treatment facilities,
also requires a cost-share whereby each grantee must provide
25% of the project's total cost. The six projects included for
funding are located in Lowndes County, Alabama ($575,000);
Upper Patuxent River Watershed, Maryland ($1,000,000); West
Philadelphia and Rodale Institute Farm, Pennsylvania
($1,700,000); Upper Rio Grande Valley Colonias, Texas
($900,000); Chittenden County, Vermont Integrated Water
Resource Project ($3,050,000); and Mud River Watershed, Lincoln
County, West Virginia ($1,000,000). As in previous years, these
projects were determined by non-governmental, independent
analysis based upon their unique and diverse geology and
geography, their ability to provide the greatest technological
diversity using limited financial resources, and the commitment
of each community or regional area to find and fund appropriate
alternative technologies to resolve their wastewater treatment
needs.
Within the State and Tribal Categorical Grant program,
the conference agreement includes:
1. $225,000,000 for air resource assistance grants under
sections 103 and 105 of the Clean Air Act, of which $10,000,000
is for the five State/Regional Haze planning organizations;
2. $192,500,000 for section 106 water pollution control
grants;
3. $10,000,000 for the Beach Environmental Assessment and
Coastal Health Act (BEACH) grant program;
4. $240,000,000 for section 319 non-point source
pollution grants;
5. $19,999,900 for the information exchange network grant
program; and
6. $15,000,000 for the new targeted watershed grant
program.
The conferees have not provided funding for the State
Multimedia Enforcement Grant program or for maintenance of the
Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota.
The conferees agree that $314,887,000 is provided for
cost-shared grants to communities or other governmental
entities for construction of water and wastewater treatment
facilities and infrastructure and for groundwater protection
infrastructure. Each such grant shall be accompanied by a cost-
share requirement whereby, regardless of the amount provided
herein for each grant, 45 percent of a project's cost is to be
the responsibility of the community or entity consistent with
long-standing guidelines of the Agency. These guidelines also
offer flexibility in the application of the cost-share
requirement for those few circumstances when meeting the 45
percent requirement is not financially possible. The Agency is
commended for its past efforts in working with communities and
other entities to resolve problems in this regard, and it is
expected that this high level of effort and flexibility will
continue throughout fiscal year 2003.

replacement of the 11th Street Wastewater Lift Station; and
483. $571,500 to the Village of Beach Bottom, West
Virginia for the extension of water lines, water plant
construction and water line replacement.
Administrative Provisions
The conferees have again this year included an
administrative provision giving the Administrator specific
authority to, in the absence of an acceptable tribal program,
award cooperative agreements to federally recognized Indian
Tribes or Intertribal consortia so as to properly carry out
EPA's environmental programs.
Also again this year and in order to continue providing
sufficient and necessary resources for EPA's pesticide re-
registration program, the conferees have included bill language
which authorizes for one year the collection by EPA of
$21,500,000 in maintenance fees. This provision extends to
September 30, 2003 the date upon which such authority for
collections expires. Additionally, bill language has again been
included which prohibits the use of funds to promulgate a final
regulation to implement changes in the payment of pesticide
tolerance processing fees as proposed at 64 Federal Register
31040, or any similar proposal; and prohibiting the collection
of pesticide registration fees if a new maintenance fee has
gone into effect.
Finally, the conference agreement includes bill language
as proposed by the Senate requiring the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency to enter into a cooperative
agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the
impact of the final rule relating to prevention of significant
deterioration and non-attainment of new source review (NSR)
published in the Federal Register on December 31, 2002.
Executive Office of the President
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY
Appropriates $5,368,000 as proposed by the Senate instead
of $5,750,000 as proposed by the House.
The conferees direct that the progress report on the
Administration's interagency global change research program, as
included in the Senate report, be submitted to the Committees
on Appropriations by May 30, 2003.
The conferees strongly encourage OSTP to address the
following critical issues introduced by the Senate: (1)
achieving a balanced and appropriately funded Federal research
portfolio, particularly as it relates to the physical sciences
and engineering disciplines; (2) developing the means to
increase the number of U.S. students pursuing undergraduate and
advanced degrees in science and engineering and fostering
partnerships between federal agencies and universities to meet
this goal; (3) addressing the infrastructure needs for an
oceans research program; and (4) developing a long-term
strategy for developing the nation's semi-conductor
manufacturing capabilities.
COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AND OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
Appropriates $3,031,000 for the Council on Environmental
Quality and Office of Environmental Quality as proposed by the
House and the Senate. The conferees have again this year
included language proposed by the House and the Senate which
authorizes the Council to operate with one member, that member
acting as chairman of the Council.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $30,848,000 for the Office of Inspector
General, the same amount as included in both the House and
Senate bill. Funds for this account are derived from the Bank
Insurance Fund, the Savings and Loan Insurance Fund, and the
FSLIC Resolution Fund and are therefore not reflected in either
the budget authority or budget outlay totals.
Federal Emergency Management Agency
The conferees are in agreement that FEMA is to implement
the minority emergency preparedness demonstration program as
structured in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations Act. The
program is to be funded at not less than $1,500,000. FEMA is
directed to provide a report to the Congress, by April 15,
2003, on the implementation of this program.
DISASTER RELIEF
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $800,000,000 for disaster relief, instead of
$1,820,000,000 as proposed by the House and $842,843,000 as
proposed by the Senate. This level of funding is understood to
be sufficient to address all anticipated needs when the current
unallocated and unobligated balances available to FEMA are
considered. The post-disaster hazard mitigation set-aside that
is provided to states is reduced from 15 percent to 7.5 percent
since the conferees have included a new National Pre-Disaster
Mitigation Fund, as proposed in the budget request. The budget
request had proposed elimination of this set-aside.
The conferees have included a provision, as proposed by
the House, which directs FEMA to provide Public Assistance and
Hazard Mitigation grants to the Texas Medical Center as if it
were an eligible applicant under the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Acts as amended. The
Texas Medical Center is expected to maintain at least the
existing level of insurance coverage which was in place at the
time of the 2001 floods. The Senate had not addressed this
issue.
Retains language included by the both the House and
Senate which provides for the transfer of funds to the
consolidated grant management program and the Office of
Inspector General.
The conferees have added a new proviso which reduces
funding for a seismic mitigation project at California State
University, San Bernardino, and directs FEMA to use the funding
instead to mitigate fire danger due to bark beetle infestation
in the area of San Bernardino National Forest.
The conferees urge FEMA to work with Santa Monica College
to resolve any outstanding claims resulting from the Northridge
earthquake.
NATIONAL PRE-DISASTER MITIGATION FUND
Appropriates $150,000,000 for the National Pre-Disaster
Mitigation Fund, instead of $250,000,000 as proposed by the
House and $25,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees are in agreement that FEMA is directed to
provide grants of $250,000 to each of the 50 states and five
other recognized entities for planning pre-disaster mitigation
projects. The conferees also direct FEMA to work with the State
University System of Florida on comprehensive hurricane
mitigation research. The conferees are in agreement that FEMA
should continue the Disaster Resistant University program and
direct FEMA to carry out the direction contained in House
Report 107-740.
DISASTER ASSISTANCE DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The conferees agree to provide a limitation on
administrative expenses of $557,000 for the disaster assistance
direct loan program account. The amount provided is the same as
in both the House and the Senate bills.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $245,690,000 for salaries and expenses
instead of $250,690,000 as proposed by the House and
$239,690,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees are in
agreement that the highest priority for FEMA should be to add
at least 24 full time equivalents for its Financial and
Acquisition Management Division and 27 for the United States
Fire Administration.
FEMA is directed to provide $1,750,000 to the
Administrative and Resource Planning Directorate for its effort
to archive key agency documents by digitization to optical
disks, including related activities.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $14,000,000 for the Office of Inspector
General, instead of $11,549,000 as proposed by the House and
$17,754,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees direct the FEMA Inspector General to review
the Assistance to Firefighters Grants program to assess the
extent to which FEMA is implementing the ``maintenance of
needs'' requirements under this program. A report is due no
later than August 15, 2003.
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND ASSISTANCE
Appropriates $388,299,000 for emergency management
planning and assistance instead of $367,040,000 as proposed by
the House and $1,615,214,000 as proposed by the Senate. The
conferees have not included in this account any funding for the
Firefighters Assistance Grants program or the administration of
the program in this account as proposed by the Senate. Instead,
those funds are provided in a new account as proposed by the
House.
In addition, the conferees have agreed to provide
$2,900,000 by transfer from the disaster relief account for the
consolidated emergency management performance grant program.
The conferees have included in the bill a listing of
funds for specific programs or activities, including
$20,000,000 for Community Emergency Response Teams and
$25,000,000 for emergency operations centers. The bill language
specifies $165,000,000 for emergency management performance
grants (EMPG), an increase of $49,000,000 to the budget request
of $116,000,000. The conferees have taken this action because
EMPG is the backbone of the nation's emergency management
system, builds state and local emergency management capability,
is the foundation for first responder activities, and because
this important activity has been severely underfunded for many
years. Now more than ever, the planning activities carried out
in this program are of utmost importance. The conferees believe
FEMA should consider an allocation system for these funds that
takes into consideration not only population, but also risk and
vulnerability assessments.
Also included is $25,000,000 for interoperable
communications equipment. The conferees are concerned that
despite clearly identified deficiencies, there is still no
overall Federal plan for the acquisition of communications
equipment. FEMA is directed to provide a comprehensive plan to
the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate for
the acquisition of interoperable communications equipment by
April 15, 2003.
The conferees have included $60,000,000 for the 28
existing Urban Search and Rescue Teams (USAR). This is in
addition to $32,400,000 appropriated in the fiscal year 2002
Supplemental Appropriations Act. The conferees commend these
USAR teams for their commitment as front-line first responders
to both natural disasters and terrorist acts. Except for up to
five percent of these funds which can be used to support FEMA's
administrative costs, the conferees direct all these funds to
be used to support the cost of operations, the cost of urban
search and rescue equipment (including equipment necessary to
operate in an environment contaminated or otherwise affected by
a weapon of mass destruction) and the cost of all needed
training, including training for responding to an environment
contaminated or otherwise affected by a weapon of mass
destruction.
The conferees are in agreement that FEMA is directed to
continue its partnership with the National Technology Transfer
Center at the fiscal year 2000 level to bring technology
applications to the local, state, and Federal levels of the
emergency management community for the purpose of responding to
both natural disasters and terrorist attacks and reducing their
impact.
FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
Appropriates $750,000,000 for firefighter assistance
grants instead of $450,000,000 as proposed by the House. The
Senate had proposed funding of $900,000,000 for this activity
as part of the Emergency Management Planning and Assistance
account. The conferees have included language which provides
for the transfer to salaries and expenses of up to five percent
of the funding for purposes of administering the program, and
has made the funding available for a two year period of
obligation.
The conferees have agreed to establish this new
appropriations account for firefighter assistance grants so
that there will be no doubt as to the importance of this
program and to protect this program from being lost in the
morass of the Department of Homeland Security.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel provide
critical services, and are often the first responders in an
emergency. As one of the activities permitted under the Fire
Act, the conferees encourage FEMA to allow appropriate EMS
providers to be considered eligible recipients of fire grant
funds.
RADIOLOGICAL AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Provides for the receipt and expenditure of fees
collected as authorized by Public Law 106-377. Both the House
and the Senate included this provision in their respective
bills.
CERRO GRANDE FIRE CLAIMS
Appropriates $90,000,000 for Cerro Grande fire claims
settlement instead of $100,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The House had not included funding for this program. The
conferees have included bill language which makes up to
$5,000,000 of the funds available for administrative purposes.
The conferees direct all audit requirements to be complied with
as identified in the Senate report. The conferees expect FEMA
and the Cerro Grande Fire Claims Office to expedite all claims
to bring this effort to closure.
EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAM
Appropriates $153,000,000 for the emergency food and
shelter program as proposed by both the House and the Senate.
FLOOD MAP MODERNIZATION FUND
Appropriates $150,000,000 for the Flood Map Modernization
Fund, instead of $200,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$100,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
The conferees agree that $2,000,000 shall be made
available to the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation (DEC) for the New York Flood Plain Mapping program
and encourage FEMA to integrate the New York DEC into the
overall program. The conferees agree that $250,000 shall be
made available to the Canaan Valley Institute for development
of flood plain maps. Finally, the conferees agree that
$2,000,000 is to be used for the Louisiana pilot project to
provide two-foot contour interval mapping.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide up to $32,393,000 for
salaries and expenses, $77,666,000 for flood mitigation
activities, a limitation of $55,000,000 for operating expenses,
$529,380,000 for agents' commissions and taxes, and $40,000,000
for interest on Treasury borrowings. Finally, the conferees
agree that up to $20,000,000 may be transferred for expenses
under section 1366 of the National Flood Insurance Act. All of
the foregoing amounts were the same in both the House and
Senate bills.
NATIONAL FLOOD MITIGATION FUND
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide for the transfer of up to
$20,000,000 from the National Flood Insurance Fund to the
National Flood Mitigation Fund as proposed by both the House
and the Senate.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The conferees have included two administrative provisions
which address issues related to funds appropriated in response
to the terrorist incidents of September 11, 2001.
The conferees have included language as proposed by the
House which gives FEMA authority to reimburse the City of New
York and the State of New York for costs which are not
otherwise eligible under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief
and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended. The conferees have
deleted a proviso carried by the House which would have limited
funds available for this purpose; however, the conferees do not
support any additional new appropriations for these costs above
amounts already appropriated. The conferees have added a
proviso to the House language which directs FEMA to use
$90,000,000 of funds previously appropriated to support the
long-term medical monitoring of the physical and mental health
of emergency services personnel, rescue and recovery personnel,
and volunteers exposed to environmental contaminants and
psychological trauma in the wake of the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York City,
including $25,000,000 for current and retired New York City
firefighters. Activities undertaken are to include clinical
examinations and evaluation, and should build upon existing
activities for baseline and long-term medical monitoring
undertaken with funding appropriated for this purpose in Public
Law 107-117 and other funding provided by FEMA for the purpose
of baseline medical monitoring of emergency services personnel
and rescue and recovery personnel after the events of September
11, 2001, including current and retired New York City
firefighters. In carrying out these activities, FEMA shall work
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, affected
labor organizations, and other relevant parties.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is
directed to provide, from the Disaster Relief Fund, for the
response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, up to
$1,000,000,000 to establish a captive insurance company or
other appropriate insurance mechanism. The insurance will
provide the City of New York and its debris removal contractors
with coverage for claims arising from debris removal performed
after collapse of World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on
September 11, 2001, including claims brought by City of New
York employees. This liability insurance may not cover those
claims arising from the terrorist-related aircraft crashes of
September 11, 2001 (liability for which is governed and limited
by Section 408 of the Air Transportation Safety and System
Stabilization Act (49 U.S.C. Sec. 40101)), or any actions or
events prior to or including the September 11, 2001 collapse of
the WTC buildings. Further, this liability insurance may not
cover payments claimed by the City of New York for workers
compensation, or disability or retirement benefits. The
contribution of the Federal government to this insurance
mechanism shall not exceed $1,000,000,000. Obligation of funds
under this provision will be contingent on FEMA's prior review
and approval of proposed insurance terms, conditions and scope
of coverage. The State of New York will report not less than
quarterly, beginning on June 30, 2003, to the Committees on
Appropriations and FEMA regarding the expenditure of and
investment earnings from the funds.
Also included is an administrative provision proposed by
the House which specifies that a hospital meeting the standard
for occupancy under regulation established by the California
Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development shall also
have satisfied FEMA's criteria for ``immediate occupancy.''
General Services Administration
FEDERAL CITIZEN INFORMATION CENTER FUND
Appropriates $11,541,000 as proposed by the House instead
of $12,541,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
continue to be supportive of the Federal Citizen Information
Center (FCIC) mission to be a one-stop provider of Federal
information to the public through print, media, telephone, and
online. As FCIC responsibilities expand to better serve the
public within a newly established GSA organization, the
conferees emphasize that the funds appropriated from this
account are available solely for FCIC staffing and activities
to achieve its core mission as presented to and approved by the
Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate.
Interagency Council on the Homeless
OPERATING EXPENSES
Appropriates $1,500,000 for operating expenses of the
Interagency Council on the Homeless as proposed by the Senate,
instead of no funds proposed by the House. The conferees have
created this new funding account to better coordinate homeless
programs pursuant to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Act. In this
regard the conferees expect HUD to continue providing
administrative support on a reimbursable basis to the Council.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Of the amounts approved by the conferees in this
agreement, NASA must limit reprogramming of funds between
programs and activities to not more than $500,000 without prior
notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the House
and Senate. Any activity or program cited in this report shall
be construed as the position of the conferees and should not be
subject to reductions or reprogramming without prior approval.
NASA shall provide outyear implications of all reprogrammings
and operating plan changes should the Committees request the
information.
The conferees are in agreement with the Senate direction
for a report on the risks associated with illegal transfer or
theft of sensitive technologies. The conferees are also in
agreement with the House direction calling for a comprehensive
review of all elements of the Integrated Financial Management
Program with a goal of reducing the overall cost and require
submission of the report no later than April 15, 2003.
The conferees have received the report of NASA's Research
Maximization and Prioritization (ReMAP) task force, which
focused on prioritizing scientific research to be conducted on
the ISS through NASA's Office of Biological and Physical
Research. The conferees agree on the need for a strategy of
prioritized research objectives across multiple disciplines,
and commend NASA for establishing the ReMAP activity.
However, the conferees have several areas of concern
related to the ReMAP process. The conferees are aware that a
number of the ReMAP task force members dissented with the
conclusions in the final report. Several task force members
stated that the ReMAP process did not allow sufficient time or
resources to do a proper job of prioritizing research programs.
Concern was also expressed by some task force members about a
lack of time to review the information reported as ReMAP
conclusions. Finally, the conferees also note NASA's
acknowledgement that the task force did not address ISS
commercialization issues, nor did it consider the research
needs of the Office of Earth Science or the Office of Space
Science in its prioritization activity.
Therefore, the conferees direct NASA to report to
Congress on its plans to establish a process by which
prioritization of research conducted on the ISS occurs on a
regular basis, rather than as a one-time effort. Furthermore,
the conferees encourage that future ISS research prioritization
activities address ISS commercialization programs, as well as
the needs of the Offices of Space and Earth Science.
HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $6,180,900,000 for human
space flight instead of $6,095,900,000 as proposed by the
Senate and $6,130,900,000 as proposed by the House.
Additionally, the conferees have agreed to a limitation of
$35,000 for official reception and representation as proposed
by the Senate instead of $24,000 as proposed by the House.
The conferees have included an additional $50,000,000 for
expenses related to the investigation into the tragic loss of
the space shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003. This funding
may also be used to correct identified deficiencies and to
defray any other expenses which are a consequence of the
accident. The conferees recognize that the cost of the
investigation and any other implications of the accident may
well exceed the amount provided and will entertain operating
plan changes to accommodate necessary adjustments in the
funding of the various components of this account.
SCIENCE, AERONAUTICS, AND TECHNOLOGY
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The conferees agree to provide $9,207,665,000 for human
space flight instead of $9,144,500,000 as proposed by the House
and $9,003,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. Additionally, the
conferees have agreed to a limitation of $35,000 for official
reception and representation as proposed by the Senate instead
of $24,000 as proposed by the House.
Space Science
The conferees have agreed to provide an increase of
$109,960,000 to the budget request for space science programs.
The conferees agree to the following changes to the
budget request:
1. An increase of $95,000,000 for the Pluto-Kuiper Belt
mission.
2. An increase of $20,000,000 for the Jupiter Icy Moons
Orbiter (JIMO) program.
3. An increase of $1,800,000 for the propulsion testing
facility at the University of Alabama, Huntsville.
4. An increase of $450,000 for the Ultra-lightweight
Electroformed Segmented Large Aperture Optics program at
Alabama A&M University.
5. An increase of $810,000 for the High Energy Photonics
Instrumentation Lab at the University of Alabama, Huntsville.
6. An increase of $3,000,000 for development of a
lightweight carrier pallet to support the Hubble Space
Telescope program.
7. An increase of $19,000,000 to the Mars program to
cover recent cost increases.
8. An increase of $1,800,000 for the Center for Life in
Extreme Environments at Montana State University.
9. An increase of $2,250,000 for the Hubble Telescope
Project at Marshall University, Bridgeport, West Virginia.
10. An increase of $1,350,000 for the Space Science and
Engineering Lab at Montana State University in Bozeman.
11. A decrease of $16,500,000 available due to the
cancellation of the Flight Projects building construction
project at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
12. A decrease of $10,000,000 to the Nuclear Electric
Propulsion program.
13. A decrease of $9,000,000 to the Nuclear Power
program.
The conferees are concerned that the recent Small
Explorer competition may have unfairly judged the Satellite
Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP) proposal as having too
much technology risk when, in fact, as the conferees
understand, it was through neglect on the part of NASA that the
investigator team did not receive adequate funds as promised to
retire this risk. The conferees direct NASA to conduct an
impartial and thorough evaluation of the Small Explorer
competition and any agreements made prior to the competition to
ensure that the STEP proposal was treated in a fair and just
manner.
The conferees commend NASA for the continued success of
the Hubble Space Telescope and the extraordinary contributions
it has made to the advancement of science. The recent success
of the Hubble servicing mission has underscored the continued
importance of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). NASA's plan for
HST has been to discontinue servicing missions after 2004 in
order to create a funding wedge for the next generation space
telescope (NGST), the science community's highest priority, and
to return HST to earth in 2010. Due to the loss of Columbia,
the conferees are aware that the current schedule for servicing
HST has potentially been delayed and that the additional delay
could possibly cause degradation of HST earlier than currently
anticipated. The current situation may also require additional
funding for HST. The conferees direct the program manager to
maintain the current schedule for NGST development and not
reduce NGST funds to cover HST shortfalls. The conferees direct
NASA to carry out an in-depth study of an additional servicing
mission (SM5) in the 2007 timeframe that would study operating
HST until the Webb Telescope becomes operational. The study
should address the costs of an additional servicing mission and
the potential scientific benefits. Further, the conferees
direct NASA to study the means for disposing of Hubble
following the deployment of the Webb Telescope in the 2010
timeframe. This study should examine the full range of options
for disposal of the Hubble including relative costs and mission
constraints.
Biological and Physical Research
The conferees have agreed to provide an increase of
$26,505,000 to the budget request for biological and physical
sciences programs.
The conferees agree to the following changes to the
budget request:
1. An increase of $3,600,000 for the Space Radiation
program at Loma Linda University Hospital.
2. An increase of $900,000 for Canisius College for
multi-user scientific equipment in life sciences.
3. An increase of $900,000 for the Institute for
Proteomic and Nanobiotechnology at Northwestern University.
4. An increase of $500,000 for the Center for Research
and Training in gravitational biology at North Carolina State
University.
5. An increase of $4,500,000 for the National Center of
Excellence in Infotonics in Buffalo, New York.
6. An increase of $8,000,000 for procurement of animal
and plant habitats for the international space station.
7. An increase of $3,330,000 for Commercial Space
Centers.
8. An increase of $6,750,000 for the National Space
Biomedical Research Institute.
9. An increase of $900,000 for bone and muscle loss
studies at the University of Connecticut Health Center.

Sciences at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas.
11. An increase of $1,350,000 for interactive biological
crystallization technology development.
12. An increase of $1,350,000 for the Life Sciences
Center at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
13. An increase of $900,000 for the Biomedical
Engineering Facility at Rutgers University, Piscataway, New
Jersey.
14. An increase of $225,000 for bone blood studies
related to human space flight at the University of Vermont.
15. An increase of $2,250,000 for the Life Sciences
building at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.
16. A decrease of $11,200,000 from the Generations
program.
Earth Science
The conferees have agreed to provide an increase of
$90,735,000 to the budget request for earth science programs.
The conferees agree to the following changes to the
budget request:
1. An increase of $1,800,000 for the Advanced Tropical
Remote Sensing Center of the National Center for Tropical
Remote Sensing Applications and Resources at the Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.
2. An increase of $450,000 for continuation of emerging
research that applies remote sensing technologies to forest
management practices at the State University of New York,
College of Environmental Sciences and Forestry.
3. An increase of $2,250,000 for NASA's Regional
Application Center for the Northeast.
4. An increase of $15,500,000 for the Institute for
Scientific Research for development and construction of
research facilities.
5. An increase of $1,575,000 for on-going activities at
the Goddard Institute for Systems, Software, and Technology
Research, including UAV and remote sensing technology research.
6. An increase of $585,000 for the Center for Marine
Remote Sensing at the University of New Hampshire.
7. An increase of $900,000 for the Clustering and
Advanced Visual Environments Initiative.
8. An increase of $5,400,000 for data storage back-up and
recovery managed services that supports the Goddard Space
Flight Center (GSFC) programs, providing heterogeneous support
to existing information systems and scalability to serve future
requirements.

has not requested sufficient funding to enable the Small
Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) program to demonstrate
the practical application of the SATS program concept, which
offers the promise of extending reliable point-to-point air
service to smaller communities and has provided this increase.
The additional funding is to be invested through the governance
process of the National Consortium for Aviation Mobility
(NCAM), exclusively for acceleration of regional service
demonstrations that apply those SATS and related technologies
ready for implementation, and for automotive technology
transfer. The conferees expect NCAM to use these additional
funds to accelerate the planning and conduct of SATS regional
service demonstrations in states with strong state, community,
and transportation service provider participation in the NCAM
partnership. This funding for NCAM is in addition to the
$11,750,000 proposed by NASA for fiscal year 2003. Further, the
conferees expect the SATS service demonstrations to provide the
participating communities and their representative
organizations with an opportunity to participate in SATS
transportation service demonstrations, an analysis of economic
impacts and related implications of improved air access to
smaller communities, and an explanation of the technologies
behind the concept.
28. An increase of $450,000 for Advanced Space Propulsion
Material Research and Technology Center at Alabama A&M
University.
29. An increase of $900,000 for high temperature

Information Based Aeronautics Consortium based in partnership
at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland, Bowie State
University and the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore.
31. An increase of $2,700,000 for the Stennis Space
Center for the development of a visitor's center.
32. An increase of $2,700,000 for the North Alabama
Science Center in Huntsville, Alabama for the acquisition,
networking, and operation of additional immersive reality
science laboratories on behalf of the Alabama Science Center
Alliance to assure statewide science education program access
by Alabama's K-12 students and teachers.
33. An increase of $2,700,000 for the University of
Alabama in Huntsville to augment the UAH Propulsion Test
Facility.
34. An increase of $675,000 for the National Institute
for Aviation Research for Icing Aviation Safety Research in
Kansas.
35. An increase of $4,050,000 for propulsion test complex
upgrades and other basic infrastructure upgrades at the Stennis
Space Center.
36. An increase of $1,800,000 for the National Technology
Transfer Center at Wheeling Jesuit University.
37. An increase of $3,600,000 for development of advanced
metallic joining technologies for aerospace applications at the
Michoud Space Center.
38. An increase of $4,450,000 for information technology
infrastructure improvements at NASA facilities.
39. An increase of $3,150,000 for a Center of Excellence
for Aerospace Propulsion Particulate Emissions Reduction at the
University of Missouri-Rolla.
40. A decrease of $40,000,000 to the Space Launch
Initiative program. The conferees have taken this action
without prejudice. The conferees note that the Congress
received a budget amendment on November 7, 2002, which
restructured the Space Launch Initiative with the goal of
developing an Orbital Space Plane with ISS crew return
capability by 2010. Fiscal year 2003 funding for the Orbital
Space Plane was set at $296,000,000 in the budget amendment.
This funding level is not endorsed or denied by the conferees
and is therefore subject to change by NASA as it formulates its
operating plan for fiscal year 2003. The conferees look forward
to working with NASA during the review of the fiscal year 2004
budget request to learn more precisely the elements that
comprise the cost estimates NASA has provided in the budget
amendment and other documents submitted to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and Senate.
The conferees note that neither House nor Senate bills
and reports contained any direction on the rotorcraft
technology program because there was no request for funding in
the fiscal year 2003 budget submission. However, the conferees
are aware of general NASA interest in the program and that the
Army may be willing to be more engaged in this effort in the
future. Therefore, while the conferees were not able to
identify funding to continue the program, NASA is encouraged to
look at funding options and present them to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and Senate in an operating plan
letter if so desired.

OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The conferees agree to appropriate $25,600,000 for the
Office of Inspector General instead of $24,600,000 as proposed
by the House and $26,600,000 as proposed by the Senate.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The conferees agree to include three administrative
provisions which have been included in prior appropriations
Acts.
The House included an administrative provision that would
have precluded expenditures for implementation of a non-
governmental organization for International Space Station (ISS)
research before December 31, 2003. The Senate was silent on
this issue.
The conferees believe strongly that a sound management
approach for ISS research is critical to ensuring that
scientific benefit is maximized. The investment of scarce
taxpayer funds in the development of the ISS has been too great
to leavemanagement of ISS research to a ``business as usual''
approach. For this reason, legislative prohibitions against
establishment of an NGO were included in the fiscal year 2001 and
fiscal year 2002 appropriations Acts, as the Committees on
Appropriations have awaited submission of a comprehensive plan by NASA.
The Congress has recently received the Report of NASA's
ISS Utilization Management Concept Development Study. The plan
outlines 10 business models and, based on objective criteria,
recommends an institute be adopted as the preferred management
approach. Furthermore, the plan outlines a phased approach that
would initially focus on leadership and advocacy functions and
would defer a decision on the possible inclusion of engineering
and integration functions.
The conferees endorse Phase 1 (inclusion of leadership
and advocacy functions), which is similar to what has been so
successfully demonstrated in the Hubble Space Telescope
Institute (HSTI) model. The conferees wish to point out,
however, that management of research for the ISS is much more
complex than that of the HSTI, and acknowledge NASA's
recognition of this intricacy, demonstrated through its
proposal of a phased approach.
In order to ensure the chances for successful
implementation of this very complicated process, the conferees
have included an administrative provision that limits any
proposed contractual action to that of leadership and advocacy.
The conferees direct NASA to report on the status of NGO
implementation as well as means of determining research
priorities. The first report is due March 15, 2003.
The conferees have not included an administrative
provision proposed by the Senate which would have prohibited
the use of any funds for the purchase of items proposed for
acquisition in RFP5-55151-GCE.
The conferees have included a new administrative
provision which gives NASA authority to establish a working
capital fund. The House had proposed establishment of this fund
in title IV, general provisions.
National Credit Union Administration
CENTRAL LIQUIDITY FACILITY
The conferees have held the cap on the Central Liquidity
Facility (CLF) lending activities from borrowed funds at
$1,500,000,000 as proposed by the House and Senate.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND
The conferees have provided $1,000,000 to the Community
Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF) as proposed by both the
House and Senate. Within this amount, $300,000 is provided to
augment funds available for technical assistance grants for
fiscal year 2003.
National Science Foundation
RESEARCH AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
Appropriates $4,083,000,000 for research and related
activities instead of $4,150,000,000 as proposed by the House
and $4,081,650,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees
have included bill language which provides up to $320,000,000
for polar research and operations support and $85,000,000 for a
comprehensive research initiative on plant genomes for
economically significant crops.
The conference agreement provides $4,083,000,000 for
ongoing and new research priorities of the Foundation, an
increase of nearly $500,000,000 above the fiscal year 2002
level. In allocating this increased funding to the
directorates, NSF is expected to give a high priority to
increasing research opportunities for investigator initiated
research in the core scientific disciplines. In addition, NSF
is urged to use the growth in its resources to make a marked
and substantial increase in the average award, as well as
increase the number of awards being made with a particular
effort to include those individuals and institutions not well
represented in the Nation's research enterprise. The specific
funding level for each of NSF's research activities is as
follows:
1. $574,886,000 for Biological Sciences. Of this amount,
$85,000,000 has been provided for plant genome research on
economically significant crops, including an initiative which
pursues the sequencing of one or more economically important
crops. The conferees expect that NSF will complete such
sequencing of at least one of these crops by 2004. In addition,
$26,000,000, the budget request, is provided for Biocomplexity
in the Environment research.
2. $582,235,000 for Computer and Information Science and
Engineering. Up to $12,500,000 of the appropriated level may be
used for operational support of the two terascale facilities.
In addition, the conferees expect NSF to provide adequate
resources for information technology research, including cyber
security research for individual investigators and multi-
disciplinary research centers, as well as for advanced
broadband research as outlined in Senate Report 107-222.
3. $534,057,000 for Engineering.
4. $689,211,000 for Geosciences. The Foundation is
expected to provide adequate funding to augment support for the
national user facilities within this directorate as well as to
move forward on the integrated ocean drilling program.
5. $1,041,165,000 for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
Of this amount, $179,617,000 is for Mathematics programs and
not less than $222,169,000 is for Physical Science programs.
The conferees further agree that adequate resources be provided
in support of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, the
Cyclotron and Synchrotron Radiation Facilities, and other such
important research facilities. The Foundation is directed to
provide, by August 31, 2003, a report which documents what has
been accomplished as a result of the growth in mathematics
research funding.
For Astronomical Sciences within the MPS Directorate,
$4,000,000 is provided for the Telescope Systems
Instrumentation Program (TSIP), $6,000,000 is for the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory program, $4,200,000 is for the
National Optical Astronomy Observatories, and $2,000,000 is for
the National Optical Astronomy and Ionosphere Center. In
addition, the conferees agree that NSF should provide adequate
support for preparatory work for the Giant Segmented Mirror
Telescope (GSMT).
6. $192,309,000 for Social Behavioral and Economic
Sciences. Of this amount, $6,000,000 is for the Children's
Research Initiative.
7. $252,330,000 for U.S. Polar Research Programs. The
conferees agree that OPP should report at the earliest
practicable time on the necessary work and costs associated
with the repair, upgrading, and replacement of NSF's research
and support facilities in Antarctica. Upon completion of this
report,funds available through this and other appropriations
may be used for planning, design, pre-construction, and construction
activities as identified in the report. In addition, the conferees
agree that with the funds provided, OPP may execute necessary
contractual arrangements in preparation for the Foundation's plan for
mechanical traverse between McMurdo Station and Amundson-Scott South
Pole Station.
8. $69,003,000 for U.S. Antarctic Logistical Support
Activities.
9. $147,804,000 for Integrative Activities, including
$84,000,000 for Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and
$5,000,000 for the Innovation Partnership Program (IPP). To the
extent possible, NSF should utilize funds in excess of the
budget request to support the merit-based instrumentation and
infrastructure needs of developing, HBCU, and other minority-
serving colleges and universities. With this regard to the IPP,
NSF is directed to support competitive, merit-based
partnerships, consisting of States, local and regional
entities, industry, academic institutions, and other related
organizations for innovation-focused local and regional
technology development strategies.
Within amounts made available in this account, the
conferees expect the NSF to provide up to $750,000 in support
of the National Academy of Sciences' work to develop a process
for prioritizing projects funded through the Major Research
Equipment and Facilities Construction account.
The conferees are aware that there has been confusion in
recent years regarding the Smithsonian Institution's
eligibility to compete for grants at the National Science
Foundation. This problem was recently identified as a
significant issue in the National Academy of Public
Administration's review of Smithsonian science programs
released in October 2002. The conferees are concerned that this
confusion has persisted despite recent internal NSF policy
directives clarifying that the Smithsonian is fully eligible to
compete for National Science Foundation grants. The conferees
strongly urge the Director of the National Science Foundation
to make sure that Smithsonian grant applications are welcomed
by all programs at the Foundation and given fair consideration
with all other applications based on the merits of the
proposals.
MAJOR RESEARCH EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION
Appropriates $149,510,000 for major research equipment
and facilities construction instead of $159,510,000 as proposed
by the House and $59,280,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Included within the appropriated amount is $9,720,000 for the
Large Hadron Collider; $13,560,000 for the George E. Brown, Jr.
Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation; $25,530,000 to
complete development of the High-Performance Instrumented
Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER);
$10,000,000 for support of the Terascale Computing System and
the Distributed Terascale Facility; $24,700,000 for continued
research and development of the IceCube Neutrino Detector
Observatory in Antarctica; $30,000,000 for construction of the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) aperture-synthesis radio
telescope; $6,000,000 for construction costs associated with
expansion of new facilities at the Amundson-Scott South Pole
Station; and $30,000,000 for initial costs associated with the
new Earthscope project.
The conferees have, without prejudice, not funded the
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) project in
fiscal year 2003.
The conferees direct the Foundation to include in its
fiscal year 2003 Operating Plan a report detailing approved
budgeted and actual expenditure information on each research
facility and equipment funded through this account.
EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES
Appropriates $909,080,000 for education and human
resources instead of $910,580,000 as proposed by the House and
$932,730,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree to
the following funding levels within this account:
1. $127,500,000 for the Math and Science Partnership
program. The Foundation is strongly urged to provide regular,
detailed information to the Committees on Appropriations
regarding the planning and execution of this initiative.
2. $40,250,000 for Educational System Reform.
3. $90,000,000 for the Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program.
4. $177,440,000 for Elementary, Secondary and Informal
Education. Within this level of funding, $61,000,000 has been
provided for the Informal Science program, an increase of
$6,000,000 above the budget request.
5. $160,600,000 for Undergraduate Education. Of the
amount appropriated herein, $43,160,000 has been provided for
the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, $22,000,000
is for the STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP), and $7,000,000
is for the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program. These funding
levels represent increases above the budget submission of
$5,000,000, $20,000,000 and $3,000,000, respectively.
6. $140,880,000 for Graduate Education. The conferees
have provided an increase of $12,500,000 above the budget
request to increase graduate level stipends for the research
and teaching fellowship programs and the trainee program
administered by the Foundation through its Graduate Education
program. The conferees support increasing the graduate stipend
level to $27,500 during fiscal year 2003 as the first of what
is expected to be a two-year process to reach a stipend level
of $30,000.
7. $105,210,000 for Human Resource Development. Within
this funding level, $31,530,000 is provided for the Louis
Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, an
increase of $5,000,000 above the budget request. In addition,
$18,900,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the request, has
been provided for the Historically Black Colleges and
Universities Undergraduates Program (HBCU-UP).
The conference agreement additionally provides for an
increase of $5,000,000 for the HBCU Research University Science
and Technology (THRUST) initiative within the Centers of
Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program.
While the conferees agree that eligibility for THRUST should
not exclude CREST recipients, NSF is directed to firstuse
fiscal year 2003 program funds to fully fund multi-year awards to
recipients of THRUST awards in the program's first year.
8. $67,200,000 for Research, Evaluation and
Communication.
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $190,352,000 for salaries and expenses
instead of $193,852,000 as proposed by the House and
$182,160,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference
agreement will permit the employment of an additional 25 full
time equivalent personnel for a total workforce of 1175, and
will provide an increase of $15,000,000 above the fiscal year
2002 level for General Operating Expenses.
The conferees are strongly supportive of the National
Science Foundation and committed to its mission of providing
national leadership and federal financial support of research
as the basis for scientific and social advancement for the
nation and for the entire world. This commitment is reflected
in the substantial increase provided in this Act for the NSF
for fiscal year 2003.
As Congress, the executive branch and the American people
begin to consider a multi-year build-up of financial support
for the NSF, however, the conferees also believe that a review
of the agency's organizational, programmatic and personnel
structures is appropriate and can provide assurance to the
public that the agency is positioned to maximize the
opportunities which increased funding can create. The conferees
have allocated $1,000,000 within the Agency's ``Salaries and
Expenses'' appropriation for a contract with the National
Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to conduct such a
study. The conferees expect this contract to be awarded within
60 days of approval of this measure.
Without prejudicing the outcome of this NAPA review, the
conferees are concerned about the following issues:
Organizational and program structure. Over the last
decade the NSF has evolved into a very complex and multi-
layered system of directorates, sub-directorates and programs
each with its own leadership and budget. This organizational
structure is then managed and evaluated against a system of
goals which were established under the Government Performance
and Results Act as well as a set of six cross-cutting priority
areas which change from year to year. All programs are required
to justify themselves according to how they serve both the
goals and the priorities. Assets flow and personnel are
evaluated based on such evaluations even though not every
program clearly is designed to serve every goal and every
priority. There is concern that this system, each aspect of
which may have been created with the best of intentions, may
have become overly bureaucratic. Some observers have
characterized this current structure as both Byzantine and
balkanized. This reflects a concern that the system is broken
up into large numbers of parts which may channel significant
portions of research funding into narrow areas making it
difficult for researchers to follow broader interdisciplinary
projects or innovative research areas not yet reflected in
NSF's view of scientific opportunity. Because recent NSF budget
requests have heavily favored the agency's own priority areas
at the expense of research in core disciplines, investigators
often feel compelled to apply for support in certain areas
because of a sense that proposals which do not fit into NSF's
priorities are significantly disadvantaged. The conferees
believe that a thoughtful review should ask whether the current
NSF organization and management structure and its goal and
priority systems should be simplified or changed.
The balance between field driven and NSF driven science
priority setting. Second, but clearly related, the conferees
believe that this review should consider whether the NSF's
approach to its stewardship mission creates the proper balance
between necessary and appropriate levels of agency leadership
of NSF sponsored science and the need to ensure that this
research remains principally investigator initiated work. A
corollary question is whether the structure of NSF and
management control of its priority setting methodologies have
negatively influenced the balance between NSF initiatives and
appropriate resource allocations for core science investments.
The underlying principle around which NSF was founded and
which the conferees believe is still the pedestal upon which
the success of America's taxpayer supported research rests is
that both the choice of research priorities and the choice of
individual projects should flow principally from practicing
scientists in the field as expressed through organized systems
of advice and through external peer review. The conferees
believe that it is appropriate to review whether the balance of
power in setting research priorities is the appropriate one or
whether NSF has become too directive in managing its research
portfolios.
Role of the National Science Board. The NSF is unique in
entrusting both advisory and executive authority for the agency
in an ``independent'' board appointed by the president. Recent
Congressional action has highlighted, however, the concerns
about the relationship between the Board and the agency and its
Director and in particular the issue as to how independent the
Board is able to operate given its dependence on the Agency for
financial support and personnel. The conferees request that the
organizational review of NSF here directed include an analysis
of the extent to which the Board has fulfilled its original
purpose and a review of the role and the structure of the Board
in the future.
Personnel policies. The NSF has chosen over the years to
rely significantly on contractual and on temporary personnel
assigned to the agency under the IPA system to manage its
science programs including its grant selection processes.
Almost one-tenth of the over 1000 staff of the agency are
university based researchers detailed to NSF under the
Intergovernmental Personal Act (so-called IPA's) and over 200
are contractors. The assignment of non-permanent personnel to
management positions now includes the heads of its science
directorates. The advantage of this system is a continuous flow
of individuals from the field who are current in their science.
The disadvantage, however, is a cadre of agency personnel,
including some of its most senior staff, who have less
experience and could have split loyalties between their federal
roles and their past or future employment base. The conferees
believe a thoughtful review of the agency's structure should
include an evaluation of the use of temporary staff and term
appointments, especially to the extent this involves the heads
of the science directorates.
In laying out these particular concerns, the conferees do
not mean this to be an exclusive list. The review by NAPA
should be carried out by very senior and thoughtful persons who
should feel free to analyze any other factors which the group
believes are central to the question of determining what
organizational, programmatic and personnel systems will
facilitate the most effective partnership between the National
Science Foundation and the scientific community for the benefit
of the nation.
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD
Appropriates $3,500,000 for the National Science Board as
proposed by the Senate. The House had included these NSB
operational funds within the Salaries and Expenses account as
has been the practice in past years. A representational
allowance of $9,000 has been provided for the Board.
Recently approved legislation authorized a separate
funding stream for the Board, and the conferees have responded
by creating this new appropriations account. The amount
provided is expected to be sufficient for all costs associated
with NSB personnel payroll and benefits as well as other
appropriate expenses. The conferees acknowledge this action is
intended to provide a measure of independence between the Board
and the Foundation, but nevertheless expect NSF to continue to
provide accounting, logistics, and other necessary measures in
support of the Board and its mission. The conferees request
that budget justification materials in support of the National
Science Board's fiscal year 2004 funding requirements be
submitted to the Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of
enactment of this measure.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
Appropriates $9,250,000 for the Office of Inspector
General instead of $9,000,000 as proposed by the House and
$9,660,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation
PAYMENT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION
The conferees agree to provide $105,000,000 for the
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation as proposed by the House
instead of $110,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
Language is included in the bill which designates
$5,000,000 to support the Corporation's section 8 homeownership
program, as proposed by the Senate. The House had proposed a
set-aside for this purpose of $10,000,000. The conferees have
further agreed to designate $5,000,000 to support additional
mixed-income affordable rental developments.
Selective Service System
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
Appropriates $26,480,000 for salaries and expenses as
proposed by both the House and the Senate.

DIVISION L--HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002 AMENDMENTS
In implementing this agreement, the departments and
agencies affected in this division shall comply with the
language and instructions set forth in the Senate explanatory
statement as delineated in the Congressional Record of January
15, 2003, page S838, that are not otherwise contradicted by the
committee of conference.
The conference agreement includes section 101, as
proposed by the Senate, that modifies section 308 and
subsection 835(d) of the Homeland Security Act, respectively,
by (1) expanding the discretion of the Homeland Security
Secretary in his application of listed criteria, and
authorizing him to consider additional criteria beyond those
specified in the section when designating any of the nation's
colleges or universities as a college- or university-based
center for homeland security that shall conduct extramural
research; and (2) limiting the authority of the Homeland
Security Secretary to waive the prohibition on entering into
contracts with corporate expatriates by restricting the waiver
authority only to contracts for which the Secretary determines
that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland
security. The House bill contained no similar provision.
The conference agreement expands the discretion of the
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in his
application of the listed criteria when designating any of the
nation's colleges or universities as a college- or university-
based center for homeland security. Such a center is part of
the Secretary's broad authority to conduct extramural research
under grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. Designating
a center or centers is just one way in which the Secretary's
authority can be used.
The conference agreement includes section 102, as
proposed by the Senate, which repeals sections 1714 through
1717 of the Homeland Security Act as if such sections never
were effective and replaces these sections with alternative
language regarding the application of the Public Health Service
Act and a rule of construction with respect to prior law and to
Leroy v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Office of
Special Master, No. 02-392V (October 11, 2002). No legal
inference regarding existing law prior to or after the
enactment and repeal of these sections shall be drawn by the
courts from the enactment and subsequent repeal of these
provisions. The repeal leaves unaffected pre-existing case law,
such as Leroy v. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The
conference agreement modifies a Sense of the Senate provision
to a Sense of the Congress that the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce should report legislation within six months
to protect the public health and the nation's ability to
produce existing vaccines and develop new vaccines. The House
bill contained no similar provision.
The conference agreement includes section 103, as
proposed by the Senate, which modifies sections 232(f), 234(b),
873(b), and 1511(e)(2) of the Homeland Security Act. These
modifications would, respectively: ensure that transfers of
funds, personnel, and assets within and from the Department of
Justice are governed by the procedures established in section
605 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the
Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002;
permit the Coast Guard to use pre-existing authority to accept
gifts and donations of services; and permit the Coast Guard to
continue to receive funds from the aquatic resources trust fund
of the highway trust fund for boating safety programs. The
House bill contained no similar provision.
In addition, the conferees have agreed to include in
section 103, as proposed by the Senate, a provision adding a
new section 1714 to the Homeland Security Act that requires
that any report or notification to, or consultation with, the
Congress or any Congressional committee required by the
Homeland Security Act, and addressing directly or indirectly
the use of appropriated funds, also be submitted to or held
with the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the
House of Representatives. The House bill contained no similar
provision.
The conference agreement replaces a provision (section
104) proposed by the Senate relating to certain waivers of
contracts with corporate expatriates. The substitute provision
makes changes to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law
107-296) and the Inspector General Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-
452) relating to the Inspector General of the Department of
Homeland Security. The House bill contained no similar
provision.
The conference agreement includes a provision (section
105) relating to the transfer of the Attorney General's
authorities under the Immigration and Nationality Act to the
Secretary of Homeland Security.
The conference agreement includes a savings provision
(section 106), as proposed by the Senate, relating to pending
or completed administrative actions, any proceeding, and
pending civil actions with respect to the transfer mandated by
the Homeland Security Act of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms to the Department of Justice from the Department
of the Treasury. The House bill contained no similar provision.
The conference agreement includes a provision (section
107), as proposed by the Senate, which repeals section 457 of
the Homeland Security Act, including the amendment made by that
section, relating to the costs and funding of certain
immigration services. The conferees also modified this section
to address court jurisdiction matters.
The conference agreement deletes a Sense of the Senate
provision (section 107) that states that Senate conferees
should insist that the Joint Conference adopt section 102 of
the Senate amendment. The House bill contained no similar
provision.
The conferees agree that several specific provisions of
the Homeland Security Act directly or indirectly address the
oversight and use of appropriated funds and that the Senate and
House Committees on Appropriations will review such sections in
depth.
DIVISION M--OTHER MATTERS
DEFENSE RELATED TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS
The conferees considered section 5 of H.J. Res. 2 as
passed the House, and Division M of H.J. Res. 2 as amended by
the Senate. The conference agreement includes an amended
version of Division M, as described below.
The conferees recommended retaining and amending a number
of general provisions, proposed by either the House or Senate,
which make technical and other adjustments regarding funding
and activities provided for in Public Laws 107-248 and 107-249
(the Defense Appropriations Act, 2003, and the Military
Construction Appropriations Act, 2003, respectively). In
addition, in section 109 of this division the conferees
recommend new appropriations totaling $10,000,000,000, pursuant
to requests from the White House, for selected military and
intelligence activities in support of the global war on
terrorism.
Of this amount, $3,900,000,000 is for classified programs
in support of the global war on terrorism and other critical
anti-terrorism initiatives. These programs are described in a
classified annex accompanying this joint statement. The
remaining $6,100,000,000 is for reimbursement of personnel and
operational costs incurred during the first quarter of the
current fiscal year by the Department of Defense as a result of
Operation Enduring Freedom; Operation Nobel Eagle; and related
activities in the war on terrorism and homeland security
operations. These funds are to be allocated as follows.
Military Personnel
The conference agreement includes $1,617,000,000 for
active duty pay and allowances costs incurred from October
through December 2002. This includes incremental cost increases
in hostile fire pay, family separation allowances, hardship
duty pay, subsistence and additional readiness/stop-loss
personnel. Also covered are pay and allowances for the first
quarter costs associated with mobilized Reservists and National
Guardsmen.

Defense Health Program, for the costs of replacement personnel
to perform essential duties of deployed personnel;
transportation costs to points of embarkation; funding for
temporary duty in order to sustain essential health care
services at military treatment facilities and in the private
sector; additional funds for health care to support mobilized
Reservists and their families; the costs of immunizations for
personnel being deployed, and force protection.
Reprogramming Thresholds
The conferees agree to amend the Senate's recommendation
to raise the thresholds for internal reprogramming actions. The
conferees agree to increase reprogramming thresholds as
proposed by the Senate, for Procurement and Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation appropriations accounts for
the remainder of fiscal year 2003. Changes to reprogramming
thresholds are effective upon enactment of the accompanying Act
and apply to fiscal year 2003 Procurement and Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation appropriations. The Department
shall submit Prior Approval reprogramming requests, DD Form
1415-1, in those instances when reprogramming of funds exceed
the following thresholds:
An increase or decrease of $20,000,000 for program year
2003/2005 appropriations for a Procurement line item.
An increase or decrease of $10,000,000 for program year
2003/2004 appropriations for a Research, Development, Test and
Evaluation program element.
Each of the reprogramming thresholds described above
reflects aggregate levels of reprogramming activity within
Procurement line items, and Research, Development, Test and
Evaluation program elements.
The reprogramming of funds below these thresholds shall
not increase lines specifically reduced by congressional action
or decrease congressional interest items.
No below threshold decrease may exceed twenty percent of
appropriated levels for each procurement line, or program
element, or the limitations above, whichever is greater.
Below threshold reprogramming may restore non-specific
reductions to the original level of the budget request or the
level determined in the account tables, whichever is less.
Project Athena
The Statement of Managers accompanying the conference
report on Public Law 107-248 provided an earmark in the
Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy appropriation
of $11,000,000 for development of the Project Athena coastal
defense beta site from within the Marine Corps Communications
line, PE 0206313M. The conferees agree that the line for the
earmark is hereby changed to the Combating Terrorism Technology
Support line, PE 0603122D8Z, in the Research, Development, Test
and Evaluation, Defense-Wide appropriation. The conferees also
agree that the amount of the earmark shall be decreased to
$6,000,000.
Domed Housing
The Statement of Managers accompanying the conference
report on Public Law 107-248 directed that $2,000,000 be made
available for the acquisition of domed housing in the Marshall
Islands to support Department of Defense housing requirements.
The conferees further direct that the procurement of additional
domed housing units be limited to those U.S. construction
companies that have previously built this type of housing in
the Marshall Islands.
National Defense Sealift Report
The conferees direct the Secretary of the Navy and the
Secretary of Transportation to jointly report to the Committees
on Appropriations, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, on
the feasibility of establishing a pilot project to accelerate
the introduction of next-generation high-speed sealift ships.
Such a project shall provide for the construction in a United
States shipyard of two high-speed sealift ships (together with
ancillary facilities and equipment) to be used in commercial
service and to be available to support the Navy's global
military sealift requirements. Project financing should be
derived from loans guaranteed by the Secretary of
Transportation supported by amounts appropriated in fiscal
years 2002 and 2003 under the National Defense Sealift Fund
(designated for construction of additional sealift capacity),
amounts appropriated to support Title XI maritime loan
guarantees, and sums provided by non-federal parties as
appropriate. Such report shall include an analysis of the
national security benefits of using sealift ships designed to
carry at least 10,000 tons of cargo at 36 knots or higher in
sea states of up to 16 feet to meet high priority military
requirements compared to existing sealift capabilities. Such
report shall also include a technology readiness assessment, a
financial analysis, and any additional recommended legislation
that may be required to accomplish this project.
GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS DIVISION
The conferees agree to amend section 101, as proposed by
the Senate, which allows funds to be used to settle the
disputed taking of property adjacent to the Tooele Army Depot.
The conferees agree to retain section 102, as proposed by
the Senate, which provides funds for disposal of obsolete
vessels in the Maritime Administration National Defense Reserve
Fleet, and requires the Department to report to the
congressional defense committees by March 1, 2003.
The conferees agree to delete section 103, as proposed by
the Senate. The conferees agree, however, to amend section 122
of P.L. 107-249 to create an exception to the general
prohibition against using NATO Security Investment Program
(NSIP) funds in the New Independent States of the former Soviet
Union. This exception authorizes no more than $1,000,000 to
establish a communication system that connects various NATO
headquarters and partnership for peace nations.
The conferees agree to retain section 104, as proposed by
the Senate, which is a technical correction that moves funds
from the Military Construction, Air Force account to the
Military Construction, Air Force Reserve account.
The conferees agree to modify section 105, as proposed by
the Senate, to clarify that the Secretary of the Air Force is
authorized to transfer funds to the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service for the purpose of acquiring land at Nellis
Air Force Base.
The conferees agree to amend section 106, as proposed by
the Senate, which increases the expense/investment threshold
from $100,000 to $250,000 for items purchased with operation
and maintenance funds, and includes authorization and grant
authority for projects expressly designated for the Office of
Economic Adjustment in the Statement of Managers accompanying
the conference report on Public Law 107-248.
The conferees agree to amend section 107, as proposed by
the Senate, which includes transfers of $104,000,000 in order
to accelerate Patriot PAC-3 missile production. Among the
sources specified in this general provision is ``Weapons and
Tracked Combat Vehicles, Army, 2003/2005'', for $5,000,000 from
the M1A2 SEP program. This section transfers $7,000,000 from
``Other Procurement, Air Force, 2003/2005'', from the following
programs:
Thinpack Parachutes.....................................   -$3,000,000
Replacement of Transport Aircraft Troop Seats...........   -3,000,000
Replacement of Tactical Aircrew Life Preservers with the
Navy's LPU-36.......................................   -1,000,000
This section also transfers $36,900,000 from ``Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide, 2003/2004''.
This amount includes $13,900,000, as specified by the Senate,
from the ground-based midcourse defense sea-based x-band radar
(SBX), and $23,000,000 from a Patriot PAC-3 enhancement
program.
The conferees agree to amend section 108, as proposed by
the Senate, which provides necessary legislative language for
the timely execution of funds for certain Department of Defense
Office of Economic Adjustment activities as provided in the
Statement of Managers accompanying the conference report for
Public Law 107-248.
The conferees agree to amend section 109, as proposed by
the Senate, to provide $10,000,000,000 to support the global
war on terrorism and classified activities, as requested by the
White House. The conferees direct that all funds provided
pursuant to section 109 be only for those activities cited in
this joint statement and in the classified annex thereto.
The conferees agree to amend section 110, as proposed by
the Senate, to provide authorization for fiscal year 2003
appropriations for intelligence activities pursuant to Section
504 of the National Security Act of 1947.
The conferees agree to include, with slight technical
modifications, section 111 of Division M of the Senate passed
bill regarding the Department of Defense's Total Information
Awareness (TIA) program. In two instances the provision has
been modified. First, the conferees agree to allow the
Administration 90 days after the bill is enacted to submit a
report to Congress on the TIA program, instead of 60 days as
proposed by the Senate. Second, the provision has been modified
to clarify that, subject to the other terms and conditions of
this section, the TIA program may be deployed at operating
bases in the United States to assist in the conduct of lawful
U.S. foreign intelligence activities against non-United States
citizens only. The conferees agree with the clear intent of the
Senate provision that, in no case, should the TIA program be
used by the Department of Defense to conduct intelligence
activities on United States citizens, or transferred to any
other Federal agency for the same purpose.
The conferees agree to amend section 112, as proposed by
the House, which provides the Secretary of Defense additional
transfer authority of $500,000,000, only for unforeseen fuel
cost requirements resulting from revised pricing and the global
war on terrorism. Additionally, this provision is further
amended to require prior notification of the Committees on
Appropriations before any funds made available to the
Department of Defense are used for the drawdown authority
provided in Section 202 of the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act
(Public Law 107-327).
The conferees are supportive of the overall objectives of
the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act (AFSA). Nonetheless the
conferees are extremely troubled that, in its first use of this
authority, the Administration chose to use the U.S. military
services' operations accounts as its funding source for the
initial increment of AFSA drawdown--diverting $165,000,000
originally requested and subsequently appropriated for U.S.
Army, Navy, and Air Force unit training and flying hours. As
noted by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in a February 10, 2003
letter to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittees of the House
and Senate, ``DoD cannot absorb these costs without affecting
readiness.''
To implement this provision, the conferees therefore
direct that the Department of Defense provide not less than 15
days prior written notification to the Committees on
Appropriations prior to exercising any use of the section 202
drawdown authority which would use DoD funds. This notification
should be provided no later than other required AFSA drawdown
notifications to the Committees on Appropriations (e.g.,
Presidential determinations, or notifications from the
Department of State, or others, as required under the AFSA or
other laws). Each such notification shall include the proposed
